from an anchorhold in Ireland.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">"I see a wide strand, 

clean, bare, empty, the tide far, far out, the pale waters withdrawn, held back, 

a gleaming line on the horizon. Lambent, translucent, colourless sky. The night 

stars have faded, the morning star not yet come. It is as if all is suspended, 

all nature pauses. The angels and saints hold their breath; all heaven waits and 

watches.......</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">"Will you not join us, 

the quiet, quiescent ones, those who give our lives in ‘silence and solitude, 

persevering prayer and penance'? We who are the channels of the peace and love 

that alone can turn the tide and bring the healing waters flowing strong and 

pure back to a hurting, needful world? "Anchorites, solitaries, hermits, 

enclosed contemplatives in religious Orders, hold the world in prayer to God in 

their hidden, given lives, by their love of Him and of all mankind and creation. 

A nurturing and a healing, reaching out to humanity as the arms of the Risen 

Jesus stretch out to embrace all. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Will you not join us?</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">"So that the tide may 

slowly , softly, silently turn back to the thirsty earth, and the angels sing 

and joy, and the Morning Star shine out silvering true, heralding the Sun 

cresting golden over the earth's rim..... Will you not join us?" </font></b></p>

</font>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Nestled into the 

nurturing, green-shawled breast of an Irish mountain, the anchorhold tucks 

itself away from human eyes. The rough and rocky track leads steeply only here.

</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Crimson, purple-hearted 

fuchsias shelter and encircle it... In Irish Gaelic, deora dé, tears of God</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Enclosed then by wild, 

sweet meadow, and woods, where </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">spearmint grows fresh 

and tall, and gooseberries fruit among myriad wild flowers. Trees abound - the 

protection of rowan, holly, box, ash, hawthorn......</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Gilded by daffodils, 

snow of wood sorrel, soft purple of wild violets ........blue-mist of bluebells, 

bright buttercup gold.....tall spires of purple foxgloves..... rich hues of 

autumn......Pleached white of winter......The seasons unfold as God reassures of 

His omni-presence, His unfailing love.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">And, high as it is, the 

door opens onto a wide vista of mountains over the deep valley, the village and 

church tiny far below. And always, the sky, the vast vaults of heaven, 

ever-changing, Clear lambent blue.. cloud-castled... leaden rain..... stars and 

moon following His will.....</font></b></p>

<font SIZE="4">

<p></p>

</font>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Here, a consecrated 

anchoress, a solitary nun, measures out her days in silence and solitude and 

persevering prayer, by the wide fireside, where the Sacred Heart lamp burns day 

and night....... Or at the open door, threading prayers with rosary beads, 

weaving St Brigit Crosses, knitting, stitching, hands and heart busy. She is 

alone on the mountain; birds, the wild flowers and creatures are her companions, 

birdsong, the stream's liquid melody, and tree-winds her music. Prayer is woven 

into every deed and act. Her life is simplicity. Her out-goings seldom, for 

essential reasons only.. and few find their way here. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">In the ancient rhythm 

of monastic life, where the day is punctuated by the sevenfold Divine Office, 

prayer and work merge. There is no division. All becomes prayer in solitude.

</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Growing flowers and 

fruit and herbs and vegetables, an old, old part also of monastic life, close to 

God in the tending of the earth.</font></b></p>

<font SIZE="4">

<p></p>

</font>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">By the inner gate, a 

wooden rosary with the Risen Jesus at its heart sways in the breeze, and by the 

big gate, a bare wooden cross, where pale primroses lift their faces to Him, 

bids you come to Him. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">There is peace here, 

timeless, ageless. The world set aside. A space apart, a place consecrated, 

dedicated to the Living God, to Jesus, Our Dear Lord.</font></b></p>

As the days are punctuated by prayer, so is the year marked by the great feasts 

that put the life and death and resurrection of Jesus at the heart of life; He 

Who is the only Way, the only Truth, the only Life....And so all, as He asks, to 

draw all back to His heart.. Not as the world are these honoured here. But in 

Spirit and in Jesus.... </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">Before anchorhold, 

there was a space, a time to learn what lay over the mountains, where the roads 

lead, before relinquishing all back to He Who gives all. "Will you give this up 

for Me? " And always, " Gladly, Lord." </font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099" size="4">A space to walk in the 

footsteps of Saint Patrick, Saint Columcille, Saint Brigit, Saint Kieran; to 

drink at their Wells of that Living Water of faith.... </font></b></p>
