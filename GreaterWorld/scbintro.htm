Introduction; water into wine.<BR>
We read in St John's Gospel of Jesus turning water into wine.<BR>
And we, by giving cold money to these children, can turn it into life and warmth, lovingkindness, food, clothing, safety...Money is worthless - valuable only for what it can buy and blessed by the giving thereof. <BR><BR>

Jesus when He teaches us about children is uncompromising. They are dear to Him.....Above His disciples; precious and to be nurtured and treasured. He was a child. So He knows both their vulnerability - and how they respond to loving care.<BR>
I came across "Street Children of Bucharest" when I was in Mayo, in my first few months  in Ireland. There was a newsletter at the back of a small country church.<BR>
My motives were selfish! I need to knit and crochet! When things in my life are unsettled or hard, the simple hand-occupation helps. And in the last years, I had knitted blankets and jerseys for a local charity that took aid out to Eastern Europe.<BR>
The poverty there is grinding and ongoing. And once the high dramas are over, the Kosovo crisis, and famines elsewhere take over the headlines, small charities are left very much to their own resources, doing the work of Jesus alone and quietly,  in lands ravaged by war.<BR>
As always, when "civilisation" goes awry, and political and military power-seeking hold sway over humanity and caring, the poor suffer most. And among them the children. In all the big cities of the "civilised" world, in Eastern Europe, in Russia, in Brazil, there are children forced to live on the streets.<BR>
Because, just as in London and other richer places, the unwanted are living on the streets, here, with an impoverished economy, it is the children. <BR>
The pictures in that newsletter and the stories, formed a great contrast.<BR>
On the cover, a Christmas gathering. Children brightly dressed. a Christmas tree.. Inside, the stories of some of them. A family of five, abandoned by a desperate mother, who had even sold her youngest baby. Children who had fled to the city to try to raise money to help their parents, simply totally unaware of the dangers they were in. <BR>
For there are vultures there, more obscene and corrupt than those ugly carrion birds.<BR>
Who see innocence and need as something to be exploited and profited from.<BR>
To whom, the "love of money is the root of all evil."<BR>
And I read of the caring and skill which rescued and housed that large family, in a comfortable and loving home, which intercepted those strays at the railway station, and brought their father to take them safely home again.<BR>
And, in the churches in Ireland, I saw the bags pile up, of good clothes, even pushchairs. <BR>
And I read of the Romanian Shop in Castlebar, which sells used goods, clothing etc, to give financial support to the Street Children of Bucharest. <BR>
And, last Ash Wednesday, I visited it when I was at Knock. A clean, thriving, friendly place.<BR>
All through that letter, I saw needy children in danger; small tots, who should have been safe in a mother's loving arms, bundled up against the severe Romanian winters.<BR>
And I read of the love of Christ in action, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, keeping children safe in a world gone mad.<BR>
I contacted one of the names in the newsletter. Colm Molloy. And had an enthusiastic and energetic reply! My knitting efforts would be welcomed.<BR>
For the children who came in for baths and clean clothes.  (At present thirty children attend day care).<BR>
The charity takes aid out in lorries twice a year; food, clothing, medical supplies. All given by the Irish people, who have taken these children to their heart. The transport also is donated. <BR>
Since then, I have been honoured and deeply privileged to get to know Colm more, by the wonderful medium email is.<BR>
And I have learnt of caring and compassion, of folk who give up wellpaid but unfulfilling jobs, to live and work among these poorest of the poor, for the love of Jesus.<BR>
He tells of families who they cannot take in but reach out to still. A father left with a large family, including a small baby; all they can do is give food and clothing...in the Name of Jesus... Feed the hungry, clothe the naked.......<BR>
And all the year, I have knitted and crocheted, and made cot blankets from old ones.... In long afternoons, I pray rosaries to a CD by the fire here, beneath the Sacred Heart Lamp, and work simple handskills, deeply thankful that in my limited situation, there are good and strong folk who work at the coal face, who ask for and value  prayer. For so often, we feel that there is nothing we can do.<BR>
WRONG! There is always all we can do; prayer harnesses the whole creative power of the universe, and inspires all else, unseen to us.<BR>
And thus we are shown ways to help, however slender our means and limited our horizons And in September this year, the hermitage was deeply enriched and honoured by a visit, during a hectic time here, from Colm, and Dr Viorica, the young Romanian doctor who, some 12 years ago, gave up her job to start this work among these needy and vulnerable children.<BR>
<BR>
The day was clear and sunny as we walked down the drive together; the young Romanian doctor, the Irish businessman, and the English hermit-Sister.<BR>
And I learnt so much, of this overtly Christian house, where the children all "wear" rosaries.<BR>
I saw the love in their faces for these children.<BR>
<BR>
At present, all the funding comes from Ireland. It would be so good if America, where so many have Irish ancestors,  joined in supporting these needy children.<BR>
Children are not cheap to raise; costs are daily and weekly, food , clothing , heating. Quite apart from all their other needs if they are to grow into their future in this modern world. This is not a workhouse, where charity is cold and sparse, but caritas, agape, the caring and love of a real home.<BR>
Please, read these pages, and give all you can.<BR>
They will be updated as newsletters come in. I feel deeply privileged to "adopt" the charity like this. They have no web space at present.<BR>
<BR>
Mother Teresa, who inspired Dr Viorica as she did thousands of others, to actually DO something rather that just shake their heads and tut, was wont to say, when sceptics said that all she did was just a drop in the ocean, " The ocean is made up of drops".<BR>
And each child rescued and helped is a human being, body, soul, mind, beloved of God-in-Christ.<BR>
See Matthew 25.<BR>
"Whatever you did for the least of these My brothers, you did for Me."<BR>
This problem is now into a second generation, with babies being born in the sewers.<BR>
Please help us to bring these children into Light and Love.<BR>
Read Isaiah about true fasting... Chapter 58.<BR>
God's word. <BR>
Thank you, and all blessings to you and all you love. <BR>
