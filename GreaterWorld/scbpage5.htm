Most of these children have come from the streets. In some cases we have brought together family members who have been placed in orphanages. We feel that the family should always be togther. Our practice of uniting them has ben very successful , resulting in happier children which in turn creates a more pleasant family atmosphere in the house.<BR>
These children lead a normal family-style life.  For some, their day starts at 6.30 am, when they must rise for school. They dress and tidy their rooms  before breakfast. Then there is a last-minute check to make sure all their books are at hand. Then off to school for a 7.30 am start. <BR>
These children finish school at 1.00pm. Other children start their school day at 2.00pm and finish at 7.30 pm.<BR>
The children who return from early school have lunch, then start their homework.<BR>
The children with afternoon classes do their homework early in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
They all have the help of a social worker to direct them. This is essential, as most of them at some stage of their lives have lost time at school, or not had any support at home. <BR>
All children aged 3-7 attend pre-school classes.<BR>
Most of the older children have hobbies such as football, music, dancing, singing, art and drama. All these take place outside of the house.<BR>
School reports have been extraordinarily good, considering the disturbed nature of their earlier years.<BR>
The most common remark from all people who visit St Joseph's House is how happy and contented the children are. This is a reflection of the freedom of the children, and the love and care that is shown them by their carers.<BR>
These children will need financial support for years to come, as their Government struggles with an ailing economy.  <BR>
