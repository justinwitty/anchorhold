A NEW CRISIS FOR ROMANIAN ORPHANS<BR>
<BR>
Remember the Romanian Orphanage crisis of 1990? The crisis is now even greater, as these children, now grown-up, leave the orphanages.<BR>
There is a great need for accommodation for institutionalised children who reach the age of eighteen years. On that day, they are given their few personal belongings and turned out on the street with absolutely no possibility of accommodation. This is a colossal change for them as for years they had the protection of the state; then they find themselves on the street with nowhere to turn to. A recent survey done by the Council for Social and Economic Research finds that there are over 5,000 institutionalised children aged between 15 and 18 years. This means that over the next three years there will be a great need for social accommodation.<BR>
The survey shows that these children will follow one of three routes;<BR>
1) the academic/education route ( further study, to University if<BR>
successful)<BR>
2) the professional route - full-time employment ( continued professional<BR>
training)<BR>
3) The insecurity route - unemployment ( interrupted professional training and temporary work) Unfortunately, because of the poor state of the Romanian economy, there are insufficient state plans to help these children. We have been advised by the Child Protection Dept, that this is the most urgent and important area that they need help with at this time.<BR>
Some of the children who reside with us at present will find themselves in this situation within the next few years. Can we send them back on the streets? Obviously not, so we have to look for an alternative. Our aim is to help them with accommodation, and support them while they continue their education or vocational training, or, alternatively,  obtain work. The children who will reside with us will be guaranteed full access to all the necessary courses available in order to develop skills which will allow their qualifications in accordance with the demands of the European economy. Foreign languages, computer training, communications, information.<BR>
This commitment was given to us by the Child Protection Department.<BR>
They will also have access to all types of counselling. Because of the enormous change they encounter on leaving an institution, the children can suffer from an accumulation of social problems, which hinder  harmonious personal development.<BR>
For this we need to build accommodation, on our existing site, to suit the need...... The cost of this development will be in the region of E350,000.<BR>
Our Hope, with God's help, is to have this building completed as soon as possible. With your generosity we know that we will succeed, and be able to offer shelter when needed. <BR>
