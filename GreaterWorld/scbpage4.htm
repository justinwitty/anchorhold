THE SOCIAL PROBLEMS; Vasile<BR>
<BR>
I would like to make you aware of the link between the phenomena of street children, people over 18 coming from an institutional background, and increasing criminality in our community. The street children generate a negative image of our society. They can be placed in the category of juvenile criminality, which in itself leads to major criminal activity, involving stealing, muggings, drug abuse, prostitution and even murder if not corrected in time.<BR>
We cannot identify any one type of child who decides to take to the streets, because the social conditions and different reasons that influence this decision are numerous.<BR>
Difficulty in family integration, the negative influence of the people around them, the absence of financial and material resources in the family, lack of programmes of prevention and information, lack of input from school, family, and local communities all contribute to the decision the child makes to go and live on the streets.<BR>
A child over 18 years old coming from an institutional background has all these problems, and even more, as there are not enough accommodation facilities for these children. So invariably they have to turn to the streets for survival.<BR>
We at Casa Sf Josif are contributing to decreasing the problem by way of a counselling programme, and by  the resocialisation of children who find themselves in this position.<BR>
These children are brought in from the streets, and assisted locally by social workers of the highest professional standards. These social workers carry out their duties with great love, care and understanding of the children's situation  - which mostly is not of their making. <BR>
We are for these children what they never had; a mother, a father, a friend, a model to base their life on.<BR>
Our real purpose is that these children will develop in a family-like atmosphere - giving emotional support, communication, and understanding of their problems. <BR>
Our success to date is exceptional, and we hope that we can expand our programme in the near future, given your  support and commitment.<BR>
