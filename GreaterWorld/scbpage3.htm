"Give them back their smile!"<BR>
<BR>
The street children phenomena reflects the level of poverty in a country.<BR>
It also reflects the lack of interest of authorities and society. Many charities have tried and are trying still to help these children who are so fed up of the poverty at home, of the abuse of their parents, that they choose to live on the streets. They beg on the corners, sleep on the ground near the steam coming from hot water ventilators, in the darkness and stifling smell of the sewers, in abandoned containers and derelict buildings ready to collapse over them, putting their lives in severe danger.<BR>
Being on the streets on a daily basis, I see children in whose eyes you cannot see any more happiness or joy, but only pain and fear and a lack of hope for the future. They feel unwanted; they know that there is no place for them in our society. They have learned to live in the dark catacombs of our city, and avoid the attention of authorities and the police.<BR>
They are like birds who start life with a broken wing. They know that when they grow up and have families of their own, their children, instead of having warm, comfortable beds, will have a cold box in a sewer or a deserted place. They will have only a candle to replace the bright sunlight.<BR>
We at Viitor Pentru Copiii Romaniei ( Future for Romanian Children)  are giving them hope that someone in this country is caring about them, who understands their pain, and who offers them a glimmer of hope and a lot of the love they need so much.<BR>
With your help, the generous souls of our society, we hope to be able to continue to help them to do even more than we have done until now, to help them become respected children of our country, instead of being the unwanted children of our streets.<BR>
Our appeal to you is to join with us in helping to wipe away their tears,<BR>
and give them back the smile of a loved child......     <BR>
