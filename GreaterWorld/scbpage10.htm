Where did it all start ? It is a very long story but I will try to simplify it. In 1991 I first went to help the orphanages of Romania, and for the following years, while working there with my colleague John Nolan, we noticed that there was an escalating number of children appearing on the streets begging. This intrigued us and in October 1997 we decided to talk to the people who were working with these children. There were twelve charities supposedly concentrating in this area, and after having spoken to them all we found only one person actually working hands on with these children. That was Dr. Viorica Vasiliu. Dr. Viorica had given up her hospital position to go and help these unfortunate children. The conditions which she worked in were appalling, so in March 1998  Brian Geary, Rathkeale, Co. Limerick, John Nolan New Ross Co. Wexford, myself from Carlow at that time (you could say Romanian now !!! ) and, of course, Dr. Viorica, formed a charity here in Romania called Viitor Pentru Copiii Romaniei ( A Future for Romanian Children ). Our task was to supply all the necessary aid to Dr. Viorica to help as many children as possible. At that time we had between thirty and fifty children each day coming for clean-up and to sort out their medical needs.<BR>
Being a very spiritual group we prayed very hard for direction, and we were directed by Higher Powers to buy a 5,000 sq metre site and build a purpose- built Residential / Medical Centre for Dr. Viorica to extend her work By Sept. 20001 we had opened 'Casa Sf. Iosif' - St. Joseph's house. We now work at full capacity as we have thirty three beautiful children in residence and we still attend to the daily needs of the children who are on the streets.<BR>
As you will read from the newsletter we create a family type of atmosphere, and the children enjoy all the benefits of this. They attend schools in the city as ordinary children do: they have their own friends who they have met through school, and they play and socialise with them. So all in all, while they have a time structure, they are very free as much as any family- based child.<BR>

I suppose the street children come about by various reasons. For example,parents who cannot cope actually bring their children from many hundreds of kilometres and just abandon them in the streets. When parents abuse alcohol and children cannot bear the in-fighting they leave home. Mothers who take to the streets for prostitution to survive in turn create more children and have nowhere to turn to and so on. There is none or almost no social welfare structure in this country, and everyone has to create their own survival methods and this obviously creates an atmosphere conducive to this type of activity.<BR>

At this time we have 23 staff, all Romanian, and one volunteer - Sr. Christina<BR>
a Presentation nun who retired six years ago and came to Romania to help with the problem of the poor children. She has been with us ever since.<BR>
