Dr Viorica writes; Faith, Hope and Charity Faith, Hope and Charity...<BR>
Our Christian beliefs teach us acts of faith, hope and charity and it is so evident here at Casa Sf. Josif in Bucharest.<BR>
In our undying faith we believe that we were chosen by God to carry out His work with the poorest of the poor - the children of the streets, through all our difficulties from the start until the present day were in no doubt that we are carrying out His wishes to comfort these forgotten and unwanted children.<BR>
Our hope lies in the future and with so much to be done here for these children we are committed to expanding our programme to help the most vulnerable of our society and the policy of closing down orphanages leaves charities like ourselves with much more to do in helping the affected children. Our future project is to give support to the children over eighteen who, through no fault of their own, find themselves being released from institutions where they have spent all their life and being out on the streets with nowhere to go. As you will read it is our intention to create temporary accommodation for them until they are in a position to support themselves.<BR>
Your charity has brought incredible changes to the poor children since you started to support us and we pray that through your generous and charitable nature we will be able to continue our good work here for the years to come.<BR>
The children we support come from various parts of the country and have arrived in the city hoping that their fortune would change.<BR>
We can do so much more for the unwanted children and children of poor families that wander the streets and for this we need your support.<BR>
Our policy of re-integration of children back into their own families where possible, with continuous follow up support is the only real solution to the problem of these children.<BR>
Our standards are very high and indeed we could be classed as the best in the country. No longer acceptable to us is the lack of care, love, hygiene and education that these poor children deserve and we will continue to uphold and improve these standards.<BR>
I wish to thank most sincerely our Sponsors, Benefactors and all our supporters in Ireland and take this opportunity to invite you to visit us if ever you are in Bucharest.<BR>
We have the energy, commitment and dedication to show that given the opportunity and financial support we can make a real difference to the poor of this country.<BR>
Please give us your support.<BR>
May God bless and care for you all.<BR>
