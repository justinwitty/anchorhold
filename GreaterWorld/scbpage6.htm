High Standards ....Nurse Viorica Iliescu.<BR>

When Casa Sf Josif was opened, the decor was only magnificent. Daycare consists of two waiting rooms divided by three bathrooms and a surgery and isolation room. All are completed to the highest standards.<BR>
Each bedroom sleeps four children and has its own en suite bathroom. It was the solemn promise of the directors and staff that these hygiene standards would always be kept, and improved on where possible.<BR>
Continuous coaching of staff and children helps us in maintaining these standards at the highest level.<BR>
Our Day Care is the pride of our work. The children come here from the streets and from poor families, for a hot bath, and to be treated for scabies and lice. They are treated for any other medical condition they may have. Should they need treatment that we are unable to provide then we arrange to send them to hospital.<BR>
All medicines and materials we are using are of the best quality, and, of course, the results of the treatment are excellent.<BR>
In the medical room, the children get counselling for good personal hygiene, prevention of spreading diseases, the effects of drug-taking, alcohol abuse, glue- sniffing and smoking.<BR>
The level that we are working here at "Casa Sf Josif" makes me proud that these standards can be given to the poorest of the children of out society..........  <BR>
