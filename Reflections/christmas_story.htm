<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">A CHRISTMAS STORY..</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The Christmas Fairy sneezed, opened 
her eyes, wished she hadn't - and sneezed again.. All she could see was the 
moth-eaten, ragged remains of something old and woolly, and very dirty and 
dusty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but not quite all! That was 
what had awoken her; that glimmering shimmer of starlight which somehow had 
worked through her dismal coverings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">It could only be the Christmas Star 
- winning through the rags and the grimy skylight...... Christmas! The Fairy 
struggled to sit up, using her battered, broken wand to poke through, work 
through the smothering rags.. Christmas! Oh, joy of joys! Her heart, deep in her 
cloth breast, swelled and soared...</font></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But where was she?</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">It must be the attic, yes; but when 
she had last been put away, the children's loving hands regretful and careful, 
their mother gently reassuring them that soon, soon, Christmas would come again, 
all had been neat and clean and orderly. Now? Chaos, dirt, disorder......rusty 
old grates, mouldy old clothes..... And what had happened to her sparkling white 
dress? all tattered and filthy.. And her wings! Oh her poor wings! All 
broken..... A tear came to her eye - and suddenly she heard, oh, sweet sound. 
Carols, children's voices, far, far below. That, too was what had woken her from 
a long, long sleep. And the surge of love woke again in her sore heart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Love is magic; and strong magic 
indeed on a Holy Night, for as the Fairy had realised, this was indeed that 
Holiest of all nights, the Eve of the Nativity. When God-in-Christ- so- small 
came among us...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And she looked down - and the 
floors became as glass, and she could see all the big, tall house where she had 
flown at the top of tall, fragrant Christmas trees, a new, sparkly dress every 
year, for many generations; all the stories, and all the rooms, all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And she realised that she was not 
in the old attic. There all had been clean and neat and orderly. No; she had 
been thrust, seemingly with a lot of rubbish, into a loft above the attic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Now, through the floor that had 
become as glass, she saw the real attic; and what she saw made her shiver. She 
wrapped a fold of the dirty wool round her bare shoulders, and gazed down. A 
young man sat there, in collar and tie and smart trousers, before a large 
computer screen full of figures and formulas. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The room was bare of any tree, or 
card, or even a sprig of holly; nothing to show that this was the Holy Night. 
Bare too of colour and life; all was glass and chrome, grey and black and white. 
The Fairy's heart swelled with compassion. And she peered into his tiny kitchen, 
so immaculately, unnaturally clean - and so bare and impersonal. The fridge and 
cupboards contained not so much as a mince pie or a chicken leg; skimmed milk! 
Decaffeinated coffee!! Organic cottage cheese! Broccoli sprigs! She shook her 
tattered head, and her crown fell over one eye......HER children were always 
full of Christmas!! Of JOY and LIFE. And their Christmasses celebrated the 
Coming of Jesus and joyously, with feasting and rejoicing. This poor young man! 
A tear fell from her eye - and landed on the young man's head. Startled, he put 
his hand up, and wiped the crystal moisture away; and for a moment his studious, 
serious face softened - and the carolling grew louder... Just for a moment the 
Love broke through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But the computer bleeped its 
soulless music and the magic was broken....And</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">he resumed his gazing and tapping, 
the Light gone from his face. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the sound of holy singing died 
away........</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the Fairy's eyes were drawn 
downwards, to the next floor of the rambling old house.. And, oh, such a 
different scene! The carols rang loud and sweet and true now!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">There was colour and light; that 
was her first impression. A fire burned, and by the hearth, a young mother sat, 
a baby asleep in her arms, as she watched, lovelight in her eyes, a boy of about 
six, curly headed and sturdy, engrossed in colouring cards at the table, and a 
younger girl, about three, her hair white-blonde, playing with the figures of a 
Crib, her face animated, her lips moving as she fingered the familiar figures. A 
Christmas tree twinkled and glowed joyously in a corner, and there were bright 
cards and lovingly- made paper garlands everywhere. And three stockings hung 
from the mantlepiece.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The little girl ran to her mother; 
"I'm cold, Mummy!"And as the young mother wrapped her arms of love around her 
child, the music hesitated, and the Fairy saw more clearly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The fire skulked low and mean in 
the night chill. The children were too thinly clad for the winter- time, sleeves 
too short. The tree was a tattered old artificial one..... The furniture was 
shabby and down- at- heel. With compassion surging, the Fairy sought out the 
kitchen. Cold, cold, cold. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The tiniest chicken she had ever 
seen waited in the oven; all legs and bones. A large pan of potatoes, and 
carrots enough. And a small pudding. For all these folk? She saw now how thin 
the mother was; dark rings under worried eyes; no father here then. And no work 
with a young baby..... But the love radiating! The shining of it!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Jenny sent Benjamin, who had also 
come to her, for the bread. Making toast on the glowing embers was a warming and 
absorbing task! So they gathered in the fireglow....... The Light in their 
hearts and on their faces. And Jenny fed her babe, an ache in her heart. Jeff 
had died</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">too suddenly and too unexpectedly 
to have made provision for his young</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">family. And he had been struggling 
to set up in business, a calculatedly lean time for them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So it was a struggle now, with the 
new baby too..</font></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Sighing, the Fairy looked down, as 
the threadbare rug on the cold lino became as glass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And she blinked at what she saw!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Opulence, luxury!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">A big log-effect electric fire 
blazed in the hearth, and radiators pulsed heat. Rich, thick carpets, deep soft 
armchairs, and the s heen of highly polished wood. A huge tree, redolent of 
pine, and shining and shimmering with long-piled tinsel and glass ornaments. 
Fruit in crystal bowls; expensive chocolates... </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And by the fire....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">One small person? </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">An old lady, a glass in her hand, 
expensively dressed and coiffeured.... But where was the happiness? The carols 
were silent now, for there was not here that love they needed to sing in.. Her 
face held no happiness; no Light here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The Fairy looked in the kitchen; 
oh, so warm and fitted with all manner of devices. And the large fridge groaning 
and packed. Cheeses of every nation, cream, pate and sausage; ham.... and a 
small but plump turkey nestling, well-stuffed, among tiny sausages and bacon 
rolls.. And desserts !! </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Ice-cream, cream filled eclairs, 
jostled and elbowed each other in the freezer... a large, elaborately iced cake, 
tins of shortbread and chocolate biscuits....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The Fairy fairly bristled with 
indignation!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">There were those little 
angel-mites, a few feet above all this rich indulgence, making toast with the 
cheapest bread, on a tiny fire! Cuddling together for warmth! And that young 
man! Ignorant and insouciant, lost in his tiny unreal electronic world.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">She frowned, an idea birthing in 
her.......</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And as she pondered, the compassion 
radiating and spreading out from her in that love that is itself the strongest 
prayer there is, selfless and reaching out...her heart almost bursting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And outside, unforecast, unheralded 
by mortal meteorologists, snow began falling, Christmas snow, thick, soft, 
veiling the human harshness of the world, cloaking all with the silence and 
purity of Heaven. Large shining flakes, dancing in Heaven's ageless rhythms...
</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the carols soared and gathered 
power; why, the very angels sang with them; voices sweet and pure and holy..... 
The saints in heaven gathered, singing, carolling, and watched, breath bated, 
prayer a tangible incense now.... All focussed on this tall house and its 
people... for God is a God who loves each soul as the good Father He is........</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the Fairy, love strong in her 
cloth breast, hurt for the hurt, cold for the cold, grieving for the grieving, 
shuddered with adoration and longing..</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the snow fell heavy, heavy, 
heavy...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the power lines sagged, sagged, 
sagged,</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The young mother, her three 
children gathered around her, snuggled under a blue shawl like chicks under a 
hen's wings, gazed into the embers of the fire.... the young man stretched and 
yawned, thinking of his bed...the old lady sipped her drink and closed her 
eyes.....</font></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And with a silent exultation, as 
silent as the Birth that night, the world man had made went suddenly 
dark.......As the power lines refused to accept the weight of the thick, thick 
snow. No street lights....Only the Christmas starlight, the huge, lambent winter 
moon - and that one, huge, radiant star.......... Outshining all the rest.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The mother and her children did not 
even notice that the power had gone. They were engrossed in toast and love! Warm 
together by the firelight and candle light; safe in their loving ...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The young man was terrified! His 
whole world, in his close-curtained attic, suddenly went black.. When he 
realised, through his panic, that it was a power cut, and that he had never 
thought to buy candles or a torch, he groped his slow, clumsy way across to the 
window, loud agony as he stubbed his toes on the inimical, angular edges of his 
cold, metal furniture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the sight took his unwary 
breath away. A white, bright world... No lights made by man. Starlight, and that 
huge, huge smiling moon over the pure, still world. He stood, mesmerised......</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The old lady was startled beyond 
measure. Suddenly her luxurious nest was dark - and it began to grow very cold 
amazingly quickly........ She shivered in her thin clothes... Thought longingly 
of bed - but the electric blanket would not be on, and fine linen sheets are 
very cold............. All her home was electric. Not so much as a gas 
ring........Not a candle to be had...... Memories of a long ago childhood began 
to steal into her mind. A poor home</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">- and a poverty she had vowed never 
to be near again - but warmth of a different kind, she realised, with a sudden 
pang....Too many children, too few clothes, too little food, and that poor - 
but, oh the love!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Tears pricked at her lonely eyes - 
and suddenly she heard a baby cry... And, for the first time, she thought of the 
young family upstairs. She, being on the ground floor and with her own entrance, 
had found it easy to avoid contact; had no idea how they lived, frowned at 
childish noise.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But how would they cope?</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The young man heard that thin wail 
too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">He also had avoided contact with 
the other residents. Sometimes, inevitably, they met on the stairs, but he 
rushed past, always in a hurry to get to his computer.. But also, and he knew 
this now with a painful clarity, because in the Children's Home he had been 
brought up in, there had been too many kids, far too many and too little 
affection. Always someone else needing and getting attention, until he gave up 
seeking any, and lost himself first in books, then in his electronic world, at 
work and at home.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, the light of that bright 
star entered his soul...... At the same time as it did the old lady's..</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Oh the power of helplessness! The 
strength of the thin cry of a tiny baby!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The old lady and the young man met 
at the door of the flat where the young family were wrapped and enfolded in 
warmth.. The moon beamed in on them, its silvery light ghostly and unreal. They 
looked sheepishly at each other - and started talking at the same time...... " I 
just wondered.." " The baby...." And the young mother heard them, and, the baby 
in her blue-shawled arms, the candlelight flickering with the sudden movement of 
air, opened the door hesitantly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The two gasped; for Love at 
Christmas is tangible.. Especially where a mother and baby are.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Here were they , cold and dark on 
the landing, their rich homes dark and empty - and here were these , in a warm, 
light sanctuary..........</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Jenny, of course, solicitous, 
invited them in as soon as she heard about the power cut. Love is mother to all. 
She shooed them gently to the fire; set the kettle to boil on the old gas cooker 
for a pot of tea.. set Benjamin to making more toast; opened the precious pot of 
honey she had been saving.....Put more scarce coal on the fire......Lit more 
candles...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Becky, her mother's daughter, once 
her short shyness had worn off, snuggled up to Miss Marsh; that contact with the 
physical warmth of the loving, unjudging child took the old lady's breath 
away.... And Benjamin showed his craft work to Colin... and engrossed him in the 
intricacies; a sharing that was full and whole. And the young man's lonely heart 
began to mend.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And when the carols soared out side 
- and no-one thought to wonder who was out there in the thick, thick snow, for 
Christmas magic was too strong now for human minds to question, they all, 
replete and warm, joined in... Becky by now snuggled on Miss Marsh's 
unaccustomed lap, the boy and the young man side by side on the settee.....
</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Miss Marsh and Colin were 
spellbound...........</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But could not help but notice how 
worn and thin all was; how little this loving and generous family had....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And Miss Marsh found herself 
thinking about her home; of all she had ready there; the rich, abundant 
food...... She cleared her throat - for she realised that this poor family was 
rich in ways she could never aspire to, and needed not her bounty... "I was 
wondering... how would you like to come to me tomorrow? For Christmas dinner, I 
mean? All of you?" and she smiled at Colin also.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">There was silence... The very 
carols paused in mid-verse..</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Becky broke the awkwardness she in 
her child-likeness had no awareness of. In her simplicity thee were no 
overtones, no subtlety of undercurrents...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">"PLEASE, Mummy! I love Miss Marsh!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Jenny's gaze was keen. if this was 
charity...... </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But the carols started again, and 
she saw with sudden clarity the lonely lines on the old face.... and the 
lostness in the young man's eyes....... And she smiled..A Christmas smile. 
....She had so little Tto give - but she had all. So much love in these small, 
giant souls!</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">"Oh, that would be lovely! But you 
have no electricity! And it will be so cold down there. And who knows when the 
power will be back on?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Miss Marsh knew a keen, sharp pang 
of pain and disappointment. Then Colin, to whom the idea of Christmas had set 
off a train of longing, </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">cleared his throat and spoke.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">"Well, this is just an idea - and I 
have no Christmas stuff in , but if Jenny will agree, can we not - pool 
resources? " Miss Marsh's face cleared, relief dancing through her. "Yes of 
course! If Jenny will agree, I can bring all the food here.....And we can cook 
it together?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So that is what they did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Miss Marsh and Colin went home 
clutching hot water bottles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And in the snow-cold of that 
Christmas Day, they met to go to Church - for Jenny insisted they share all! The 
snow had stopped, and the sun dazzled and radiated prisms and rainbows off the 
piled banks and ripples of it. All the men had turned out with spades and 
shovels to clear paths on the pavements. Colin had worked with them and his face 
shone with the air and exertion There was still no power, but the Church was 
bright. The sun glowed and rainbowed through the stained glass. And darker 
corners were alive with candles, for all brought them. And all shared and smiled 
with a joyous camaraderie.... And the children gathered round the Crib, 
celebrated the Coming of Jesus with whole hearts and strong voices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And then a procession! The turkey 
was already sizzling in Jenny's oven, but now they carried all the good things 
down, until the old table fairly groaned. The children's faces were a picture!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Colin vanished, to return with a 
whole sack of coal, and bags of logs; an enterprising shop had opened its doors. 
.. Boxes of candles, and a jigsaw... And the flat rang with laughter, delicious, 
rich aromas rising to heaven...</font></p>
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="4">
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">The Christmas Fairy yawned and 
drooped. Her mission accomplished, she was exhausted, and as the winter 
afternoon early darkened into evening, she knew that her time was 
ending....Indeed, she had had an extension, for Christmas Fairies only come to 
life on Christmas Eve.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">She gazed with love on the people 
below her, drinking in the glad faces, replete with more than good food.... 
Colin, working with Benjamin on the jigsaw.... Jenny nursing baby Jeff, Miss 
Marsh sharing the Crib with Becky........The candles casting their soft light, 
and the logs blazing their living warmth. Oh, it was so good; all so good! And 
it was a love that would last, and grow and heal its givers and receivers...</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Then, she started to 
feel....different ..... Instead of fading, she was coming to life..... She 
blinked.... And as she watched, her tattered, torn, dirty old dress began to 
change.. White, long, radiant.. Clean, pure....... And her shoulders began to 
prickle...... And her head felt different.....</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the dirty skylight cleared, 
seemed to open... wide onto the starry heavens..... </font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And the light from that bright star 
grew and radiated outwards, wider and wider and brighter and brighter, until it 
encompassed and embraced all, all, all... And oh! The Christmas Fairy, new, 
feathered wings outspread, white gown flowing, haloed head, floated and flew 
out, up. the newest angel in Gods's heaven.....To be where there is no rust or 
moth, no cold or darkness... no pain or sorrow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Just pure Light, shining out from 
the Christ Child to all and through all who love Him, radiating out into the 
whole world</font></p>
<p><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Light and love and 
peace.............. </font></p>
