<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">1: And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, 
they were all with one accord in one place. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">2: And suddenly there came a sound from heaven 
as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were 
sitting. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">3: And there appeared unto them cloven tongues 
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">4: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, 
and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">5: And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, 
devout men, out of every nation under heaven. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">6: Now when this was noised abroad, the 
multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them 
speak in his own language. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">7: And they were all amazed and marvelled, 
saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">8: And how hear we every man in our own tongue, 
wherein we were born? </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">9: Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the 
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">10: Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the 
parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">11: Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak 
in our tongues the wonderful works of God. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">12: And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, 
saying one to another, What meaneth this? </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">13: Others mocking said, These men are full of 
new wine. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">14: But Peter, standing up with the eleven, 
lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell 
at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">15: For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, 
seeing it is but the third hour of the day. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">16: But this is that which was spoken by the 
prophet Joel; </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">17: And it shall come to pass in the last days, 
saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your 
daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men 
shall dream dreams: </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">18: And on my servants and on my handmaidens I 
will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: </font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">19: And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and 
signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: </font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">20: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and 
the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come: </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">21: And it shall come to pass, that whosoever 
shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">22: Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of 
Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, 
which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">23: Him, being delivered by the determinate 
counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have 
crucified and slain: </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">24: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the 
pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">25: For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw 
the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be 
moved: </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">26: Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my 
tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">27: Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, 
neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">28: Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; 
thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">29: Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto 
you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre 
is with us unto this day. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">30: Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that 
God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to 
the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">31: He seeing this before spake of the 
resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh 
did see corruption. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">32: This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we 
all are witnesses. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">33: Therefore being by the right hand of God 
exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he 
hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">34: For David is not ascended into the heavens: 
but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">35: Until I make thy foes thy footstool. </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">36: Therefore let all the house of Israel know 
assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord 
and Christ. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">37: Now when they heard this, they were pricked 
in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and 
brethren, what shall we do? </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">38: Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be 
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, 
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">39: For the promise is unto you, and to your 
children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall 
call. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">40: And with many other words did he testify and 
exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">41: Then they that gladly received his word were 
baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand 
souls. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">42: And they continued stedfastly in the 
apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">43: And fear came upon every soul: and many 
wonders and signs were done by the apostles. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">44: And all that believed were together, and had 
all things common; </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">45: And sold their possessions and goods, and 
parted them to all men, as every man had need. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">46: And they, continuing daily with one accord 
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with 
gladness and singleness of heart, </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">47: Praising God, and having favour with all the 
people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. </font>
