<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">I offer these thoughts.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Many branches of the Church have 
"lost" their contemplative wing.........</font></b></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p></p>
</font><font size="4">
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Thus prayer is seen as 
physically functional. And there has arisen what some priests call the "activist 
heresy", that only missions and ministries which are visibly and practically 
"effective" have any place in the life of the Church. Many say that this is why 
the ministry of the Church is so barren spiritually.. These attitudes go very 
deep. A common attitude to someone who feels led to spend a life in prayer is 
that they must be mentally ill. Especially since that almost inevitably means 
drawing apart from "the world" into solitude. There is deep suspicion and 
mistrust. One hermit-publication ran a survey. One question asked what was the 
reaction of Churches/Orders etc to those who felt called to become hermits. One 
nun was forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital by her Order - accused of 
wanting to run off with a priest! She said that her six weeks assessment there 
was the most peaceful and blessed time....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">In truth, solitaries, hermits, 
anchoresses work and live at the very heart of the Church, for dedicated 
contemplative prayer is the vital food of any Chruch. Without it, they slowly 
starve of their life-blood... The effect of seeing PURE PRAYER as a waste of 
time and energy is to enter into seeking "new" ways to preach; great "outreach" 
programmes, frenetic activity. Which of course leads to overload.... So 
contemplatives leave the Church and the loss escalates </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Because when a Church loses deep 
individual prayer, and does not support or respect those who pray 
contemplatively, it loses touch with base and becomes a social group with all 
the dangers therein . All these activities and organisations are reliant not on 
God, but on our human skills.. So they diminish the spiritual. Accessing the 
soul via the body? </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">I see it this way.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">We have a dual nationality. We 
are citizens of earth - but of heaven. Our faith is incarnational. In Christ. 
That is how God made us. And, as the psalmist says, we are exiles, sojourners 
here, with all the longing and "dissatisfaction" that that entails. And unless 
we satisfy that spirituality, we tend to addictions; consumerism etc. We are 
seeking fulfilment in the wrong places.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">To me, there is nothing mystical 
or mysterious about contemplative prayer. It is natural; it is inherent in our 
nature. I think that children who are pulled up for daydreaming may well be in a 
deep state of prayer. And some think also that those in PVS ( comas etc) are 
also in a state of deep prayer.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Essentially, contemplative 
prayer is that that has no FUNCTIONAL USE in our limited, visible, human terms. 
It is not asking, not intercessory prayer. And it is not to soothe US, to empty 
our minds etc. IT IS SIMPLY BEING IN GOD, FOR GOD, OF GOD. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">When Julian speaks of "oneing"; 
that is what she means. A state of prayer, of being, that is simply and purely 
IN GOD. With no requests, no agenda, no "purpose" other than to be with Him.
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">A sweet intimacy.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Being with God simply because we 
love Him. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">We are thus alone with God. This 
is not public, social prayer. A joining of our souls with Him. And essentially 
thus in silence and solitude, apart , holy. The psalms and Jesus......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">At the end of the set-aside 
time..the dishes haven't been washed..the letters are unwritten. In the world's 
eyes, it has no use. No-one has been prayed for.... But here the paradox and the 
mystery.. Because God is pure love and His will for us as Julian elegises so 
often and so deeply is love....... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">We have sought no rest - but we 
are rested. We have asked no healing, no favours - but from this time and this 
deep prayer there flows through and from us the most overwhelming compassion so 
much love for others. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Because we have been IN GOD. And 
we thus have drunk deeply of those streams of living waters We have given - and 
thus we are given of His abundance. We have asked nothing - and He has given all</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">What we call "contemplative 
prayer" is not of our making. it is of Him - above and beyond us. And in that 
and in that alone there is peace and rest. And that awes and humbles.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Folk ask HOW.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And it is hard at first. Like 
all things, it takes time and practice. When I began, I set aside a half hour; a 
few minutes intercessory prayer, a few minutes silent prayer.. As I grew 
stronger, the silent prayer widened until I moved the intercessory prayer to a 
different time. And I think that a half hour a day is a " reasonable" idea for 
"active" folk. He will lead you once you give Him that space. When friends tell 
me they have lost touch with "formal prayer" in hectic lives, I say " Humour me! 
This evening, go into your room, light a candle, and simply sit with God for 
fifteen minutes" The results are immediate and enthralling..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Now, I find that what is called 
contemplative prayer takes over. It becomes second nature. I feel my breathing 
change pace. And intercession flows naturally out of it. Any simple action, 
knitting, preparing food becomes deeply contemplative.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">I can never see Julian as a kind 
of penitential restless prisoner. Or overwhelmed by the grief she sees around 
her. I see in her what I glimpse when those days happen when He is as close and 
as tangible as the air I breathe; that "oneing" that is our sole purpose and 
goal. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And the days thus when her 
curtain is closed are like the days no-one gets replies to emails. Not because 
of pain etc, but simply because that Other Voice enthralls and engrosses to the 
point where nothing else matters. I believe the technical word is 
"recollection".</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And my strong awareness also is 
that contemplative prayer and its fruit( which we do not ask for or aim for) 
alter the spiritual balance not just in the church but in the whole world. 
Certainly I have noted that prayer uttered after these times is answered in ways 
that could never be dreamed of. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">It is as if those God calls to a 
life dedicated to contemplative prayer are as lightning conductors , channels of 
grace, of God's love and His power. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">It is a joy-filled and utterly 
fulfilling prayer;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And it goes hand in hand with a 
deep simplicity; values change. "Things" matter little because true values 
return.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">Deep silent prayer is a 
belonging with God asking nothing of Him but to sit with Him, kneel at His feet, 
bask in His radiance .And it is what this world and each of us need. It is our 
home simply.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And I have a deep instinct that 
if each member of a Church was grounded and founded in contemplative prayer, 
open to God at this depth, the Church triumphant would reach out and up as He 
intends it to, instead of being too often a kind of "holy club" or a social 
group.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">To restore dedicated, 
contemplative prayer to the heart of the church where it belongs is to open the 
doors wide to God's Holy Spirit. And to Christ's world reign..........</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000099" face="Poor Richard">And this begins in each heart, 
in each life.......Yours and mine. For deep prayer is not a specialist province 
for monks and nuns, but for each and very soul who is in Christ.
