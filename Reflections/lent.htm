<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">A Lent Reflection.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">LENT; a time for 
turning.........and for loving.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Life is full of turnings. Of 
changes. Many we do not choose; these, the growing and the ageing, are in God's 
plans, as the changing of the seasons and skies. All these are in God's loving 
hands alone.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">But sometimes we need to choose; 
to consent, to embrace. Some turnings are those yearnings towards God that stir 
deeply within our souls and bring soft tears to our eyes, we know not why.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">LENT is such a time. See it not 
as deprivation! It is a self-emptying so that God can fill us with Himself, and 
with that love He holds fro us and for all His creation.</font></b></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p></p>
</font><font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">See it not as a giving up, but 
as a gaining.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">A turning towards Him. </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Which means a turning away from 
all that is not Him or of Him.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So we turn away from the "world" 
and all its values and pursuits and ambitions; we close off from its vanities 
and trivialities so we can focus on Him and all He bids us do. We leave self 
behind - in order to find selfhood in Him.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And a time for loving...When you 
love, oh yes; when you have hurt who you love, or Who you love, for all pain 
caused to others is pain to Him Who loves all, then there is inner hurt and 
weeping. So we mourn over our sin, over our lack of loving for God and for all 
His people, and thus we seek forgiveness.. And then we amend our lives; for 
unless our contrition and our penitence change our ways, then they are sterile 
and selfish.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">He is our Creator; we are made 
in His image so strive we to be true to His purity in loving. He is our Baby; so 
strive we to nurture and protect Him in all the vulnerable. He is our Lord, so 
strive we to obey His Word . He is our Brother, so strive we as He calls us to 
be kin to all, as He is. </font></b></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">All in the Light of Love.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And if we hold back, then that 
is sin. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And in these blessed and holy 
days of Lent, we can bring that failing to Him on the knees of the humility of 
our helplessness and our need of His grace. So lacerate your heart for your lack 
of love - then let the balm of His grace and mercy soothe and heal - and let His 
love for all His creation saturate and permeate your whole being and lives and 
actions, and spread and widen to cover and fill the whole world and all in it.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Then we shall be the salt, the 
yeast, the light, the love that Jesus bids us be - and only with His help and 
starting with our willingness to turn</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">and to be turned. </font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">We can align with that love; 
that is a choice we can make with our wills; then let Him act in and through us.</font></b></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So Lent as a journey; as a 
taking into ourselves more of Him. Not just for the Forty Days, but for life. 
New ways, new habits.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">AWAY from "the world".. TOWARDS 
Jesus, following God's word, .......Joel.... Isaiah.. Jesus ( These texts are on 
the home page) </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">A purposeful giving.... not a 
self-centred one.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And thus the emphasis on "sin" 
that so many find hard. For "sin" is simply a failing in loving; in loving God, 
in loving each other. Thus that great penitential Psalm 51 says, "Against Thee 
only have I sinned." ( see home page)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">There is in the west of Ireland 
a Holy Mountain. Croagh Patrick. And it is a symbol of Lent; for Lent is a 
symbol of life in Christ.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">It is a mile of steep rocky 
path, littered with stones, rock-strewn.... Marked by the Stations of the Cross. 
Many walk it barefoot. Some even on their knees.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And so in life, we meet many 
fellow-pilgrims on the way.. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And Jesus tells us to love them 
AS WE LOVE OURSELVES; how often do we shy away from the fullness of that... 
Hence Isaiah... Lean towards them! Lend a helping hand.... GIVE all you can - 
not of your abundance but of your substance. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And always, upwards</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And always towards the Cross at 
the top - and the Church where Christ is........</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Mark the steps in prayer; mark 
the days with an extra giving; of time; of resources; for all means loving Him 
more and more each day. Mother Teresa was wont to admonish people to "Give until 
it hurts". She knew the secret of sacrificial giving, of the double blessing of 
it, of the coming nearer to Christ Who gave His life when we give what we value 
most.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And we show this with our bodies 
and our substance, because Christ became man and lived as we do - a giving life 
- a giving death.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So Lent! A giving; a marking,.. 
A turning...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And let this be not just for 
Lent; but for always.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">St Francis knew the truth of 
this; he who embraced Lady Poverty to own nothing. And embraced a leper . "..... 
that we seek not so much to be consoled as to console.... not so much to be 
loved as to love.... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">For it is in giving that we 
receive"... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">That paradoxical truth that is 
the very heart of Christ.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And that thus separates us from 
"the world" and its shoddy, trivial, materialistic values.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Let us each this Lent lean 
towards our fellow-pilgrims, when they stumble on stones let us reach out a hand 
to steady them When they are hungry, feed them... Matthew 38. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So, in practice?</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">For we are always so ready to 
nod and agree, but then know not the how of it. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">That can be hard!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">If you give up eating something, 
set aside a set sum for each day. One year, I aimed to give enough to a charity 
to dig a well in a village that had no water. Aim at children? At famine relief? 
Let any so -slight hunger we might feel feed those whose stomachs ache with the 
need for food that is not there. Some speak of " raising an opposite spirit"... 
Let that be so. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">If you give up doing........... 
Let it work for others.....Clear out cupboards and let a charity shop 
benefit.... Catch up on letters to old friends who may need a kind word... give 
time and strength to a voluntary scheme, or practical kindness to a lonely or 
elderly neighbour...... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And above all, pray; not 
intercession but simply spending time in rapt silence with Him Who loves us so 
much. Love Him and be still with Him.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And why stop when Lent ends? I 
was asked one year to pray the Chaplet of Divine Mercy every afternoon. And I 
loved it so much I carried on to this day; it is a vital part of my prayer life.
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">Let your turning be 
eternal.......Let it build strength in your soul.. Let it bring you ever closer 
and closer to God. For once you have glimpsed and tasted that closeness, you 
will never turn away again.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So although the track may be 
rocky and rough, is not the goal so precious that that matters not? To stand 
atop with that wide, wide view, and with Christ in the Chapel there?.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">"Whom have we in heaven but You? 
And having You?"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">We need naught else.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">So let Lent be a joy, a deeply 
meaningful growing time. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#FFFFFF">And when Easter dawns you will 
be nearer Him and stronger in spirit and in truth...Then turn not away again.... 
Turn not your back on Him.. Return not to the world's ways.......keep your eyes 
on Him, gaze always at the</font></b></p>
