<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Advent Thoughts; towards a Giving 
Christmas....... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">&quot;And God so loved the world that He gave His 
Only Begotten Son so that we may not perish but have everlasting life.&quot; And so 
the whole Gospel Christmas narrative is full of giving; because God is. Mary 
giving her womb and her will; Joseph his heart and his hearth, giving his 
consent also to what must have been hard in that culture.... The innkeeper 
giving all he could in that crowded village.... The Three Wise Men with their 
beautiful ,awful, symbolic gifts.. And the shepherds are always depicted as 
bringing gifts....As if all echo and fulfil in comprehensible human terms that 
huge, total giving of Himself into our flesh into our world with all its 
beauties and dangers, all its apparent poverty and paradoxical riches. Giving 
because being loved evokes a response in our sore hearts, and is alone the balm 
that will heal them. For giving is the why and the how of life. For when we love 
and are loved, it is natural to long to give. And the giving of love is a 
sacrament; the outward and visible, physical sign of an inward, invisible, 
spiritual grace... But who then do we give to? How do we in human terms express 
and translate the huge, God-giving of Himself into a tiny, helpless infant, &quot;all 
meanly wrapped in swaddling bands and in a manger laid.&quot;? And how does all the 
crass commercialism connect with this sacrificial all-gift? Everyone being 
blasted from autumn onwards, scurrying round trying to give big gifts to folk 
who already have more than they need? Getting into credit card debt... 
overeating and overdrinking; because &quot;Christmas is about giving&quot;? And the wise 
pagan peasants nod and say &quot;Well, it is simply a Bacchic festival of light at 
the darkest season...&quot;And all they see in &quot;the world&quot; ratifies and reinforces 
that... So what do we do? How do we, as Christmas looms large on the 
not-very-distant horizon, give as Christ gives? How do we honour that 
world-sized giving of all? It is hard indeed. First, we who know Christ, who 
have Him in our hearts and bodies, are &quot;in the world&quot; not &quot;of the world&quot;.. He 
tells us this time and time and time again. The peace He gives us is not &quot;as the 
world gives&quot;; how often the first part of that verse gets quoted in isolation.. 
Which distorts it. We ARE different; should that not be reflected in our daily, 
physical lives? And especially at our major feasts? When we who know the 
truth... Let me tell you my &quot;solution&quot;, one that has brought and brings still 
great spiritual and thus physical peace, to me and to others. For the orgy of 
giving had long worried me; and the more I came close to God, the more my 
concern grew. He is in the poorest, in the most needy. He is in the broken, the 
street-dwellers, the rejected... Oh, I gave when the appeals came in - but 
somehow it was lip service, not from the deeps; giving of my abundance ( and, 
yes; even living on disability we have abundance) and not of my substance or of 
myself. And </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">remember what Jesus said to the widow....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">For me a turning point was the Millennium 
Services, almost the last TV I watched. Richly caparisoned church dignitaries, 
their vestments stiff with gold embroidery, preaching the Beatitudes to a 
congregation of royals and notables, discreetly bejewelled expensively 
coiffeured.. With polite, bored faces as those haunting and, yes, accusing words 
rang out And the central hypocrisy so much of the &quot;official&quot; church has become 
aroused strong, strong reaction in me. It all seemed an obscenity; a far, far 
cry from Jesus of Nazareth, born so poorly, with nowhere to lay His head, and 
yet overflowing with true wealth, not where moth and rust could corrupt, 
teaching patiently, over and again that material things have no value at all and 
can and do blind and impede us. Because I was at that time &quot;outside the camp&quot;, 
pushed away by an uncaring Church, I came to see it all so much more clearly and 
cleanly. As if through God''s eyes.. And that white light in my soul told me . 
&quot;This is wrong; this is not of Christ, not of God; not what we should be 
living.&quot; But hard to make that break? To swim against the tide? So we maybe buy 
charity cards? Later that year, I took my first formal vows as a religious. And 
that was a wondrous chance to change at least my part in all this. I simply 
declared an amnesty on Christmas gifts. I have all I need and more; I know my 
friends love me. I need no gift to assure me of that; I know God loves me and 
them. I had always bought &quot;charity&quot; cards; now I went further. I made simple 
cards on the computer a relaxing and fulfilling occupation. And conscientiously 
added up all I thus saved. Most friends with computers had ecards.... So I saved 
that saved postage also. And they even have music!! I &quot;allowed&quot; small token 
gifts. Mine were all home-made or home grown. Budding hyacinths I had planted in 
autumn.... notepaper and cards I made on the computer..... And I added all I 
thus saved to the fund; and asked friends also to give what they would have 
spent to charities. One friend, far from well off herself, said how good that 
had felt; that was the grace given to her from that giving. One thing I did not 
cut out was the Tree; on the island I always lit the hermitage gloriously, 
praying that the Light of Christ would shine out across the dark fields . I am 
awed and humbled now to know that it did and reached hearts and souls for Him. 
And when I looked at that small pile of bright little parcels under that shining 
tree my heart knew so much thankfulness ... I am loved; by God and by many.. I 
am thus so blessed. And the pleasure from those token gifts was far, far greater 
than from anything larger. For when we simplify, when we stop thinking in terms 
of money and substitute love, that happens. A strong magic. Because we give then 
of our hearts, of ourselves - as God did and does. And Christ- mass becomes 
blessed and holy, sanctified and purified by that spirit of giving. There is one 
haunting carol... &quot;What can I give Him, poor as I am? If I were a shepherd, I 
would bring a lamb. If I were a wise man, I would play my part. But what I can I 
give him - give my heart&quot; Oh, but be careful what you pray for! Easy to sing, 
but when you give your heart to that Baby-Who-is-God, you give it to all mankind 
also. Loving Him</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">- and loving your neighbour... Be careful!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And we are not poor - so when we give 
substantially of our substance, we give of our hearts.... And that giving, not 
to others who are rich , but to those who have almost nothing, becomes a prayer 
in itself, a sacrament. And thus Xmas becomes Christ-Mass . And let then Christ- 
mass spread out all through our lives; let us never cease to give then. Christ 
did not nor does not...... And that grace of blessings will stay, and will 
burgeon and blossom in our hearts, and radiate outwards with His love to all 
around us. So, tiny babe! Will we this year , really give You our hearts? For 
ever and eternity, with all that that means? Will we really give ourselves? How 
can we not? We who He blesses so richly with Himself? How can we not?</font></b></p>
