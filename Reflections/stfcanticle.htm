<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4">REFLECTION ON SAINT FRANCIS' 
CANTICLE......</font></b></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Most High, all-powerful, all-good Lord,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">All praise is Yours, all glory, all honour and 
all blessings. To you alone, Most High, do they belong, and no mortal lips are 
worthy to pronounce Your Name"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">At the end of this autumn month. I was garnering 
leaves in the forest for my new gardens, deep in the silent early day. </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Fallen, tumbled gold and russet and orange and 
brown. And I stopped in awe.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Just a few months ago, these were buds, then 
unfolding fresh green to bring us new hope and new strength, spring after 
winter. Then full, shading leaves, to give us shelter and coolth in the hot 
summer days. And now, their colour dazes and amazes, and, under the top layer as 
I collect them, are the leaves from past years, turning into rich soil. Which 
feed and nourish the roots and help produce the new leaves that are even now 
forming in the baring branches. And this is so year after year; decade after 
decade, century after century, throughout all the long millennia.... Never 
failing, faithful, strong, eternal. "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and 
to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world 
without end..."Amen indeed. </font></b></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And, crouching there as the heavy raindrops fall 
on the living canopy above me, I am almost in tears at all this. The sheer 
design and plan in it all. Nourishment for all our senses, and for our souls. 
How can we dare and presume to talk to this Creator? To raise our heads to Him? 
He is all ,and all, and all. Praise and honour be His..... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">We are indeed all unworthy; awed and humbled by 
His vast love, by His sheer power in lovingkindness..So we give Him all we are 
and all we have. Our bodies, our souls, our lives, our love. With 
wholeheartedness and joy. And we honour and obey Him and His commandments, 
without question, on the </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">knees of our souls.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And presume not to trust our impudence and 
arrogance and hubris in our mean achievements. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You my Lord with all Your creatures,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">especially Sir Brother Sun,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Who is the day through whom You give us light.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And he is beautiful and radiant with great 
splendour,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Of You Most High, he bears the likeness."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">October flamed in, with strong, robust sun, 
caressing the land in its fading, comforting, reassuring of love and life. Its 
course is lower and briefer now.....Strong, sweet, pure as His love. bright as 
the days shorten.... And even in dark, wet days, when the sun and the valley and 
mountains are shrouded in grey mist, the sun is there, as God's love and 
Presence are there. Faith is in knowing that as fully when the sun is hidden as 
when it shines... as surely, when we, with our fragile and fallible senses and 
weak minds and erring wills, these "vessels of clay", feel abandoned by God, as 
when the fullness of His love is bright and clear.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You, my Lord, through Sister Moon 
and the stars,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">In the heavens you have made them bright, 
precious and fair."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">I have lain in bed, watching a quarter moon, 
growing, in its course across my window, bright and full and silver, the clouds 
impossible in their shapes and forms, silvered among the stars. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And, later, a filigree-slender crescent, lying 
on its back gazing at the stars.........Waxing, waning, drawing tides in that 
huge mystery of the integrity of creation....... Stars that lead and guide, 
reminding always of the Christmas star, of the myriad stars God showed to 
Abraham.. Courses and patterns that have intrigued and mystified men since the 
beginning of time.. All created by and known to God, safe, sure.</font></b></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You, my Lord, through Brothers Wind 
and Air,"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Sweet, warm wind, soft and mild, then, later, 
fierce in the first near-gales of autumn. They hold no fear here, do no damage, 
for the hermitage is tucked snugly into the living breast of the mountain... The 
air, pure and strong, clean living breath, grass-fragrant... Always that clear 
purity of air, sometimes bearing the turf or wood smoke on its breath. </font>
</b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Sometimes rain-laden as autumn moves into 
winter. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And each direction with its familiar traits. 
From the south across the wide valley, rattling the front door. East and it 
touches not, until I need to go to the mailbox, when I wrap my arms round me 
against its piercing, west </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">that is gentle, and north that has no fear, for 
the mountain behind me is a bulwark against it.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And the sea-sound of the wind in the pines 
echoing in the night. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">No more banshee gales burning and destroying. 
Winds to enjoy... Strong and free... And still, mist-crowded air, when the 
valley and mountains, and even the tall alders that fringe this sanctuary, are 
shrouded and secret. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"And fair and stormy, all weather's moods,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">by which You cherish all that You have made."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And how varied and mulitudinous these moods in 
these restless months! And all cherish indeed, for the earth needs the quiet 
months, needs the heavy rains, needs the winds, to burn off summer, the frost, 
to kill disease in the soil. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So all is in order, all ordered, all as God has 
ordained in His love and wisdom.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You my Lord through Sister Water,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So useful, humble, precious and pure."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And now, the dry weeks of summer are past, and 
the water flows strong and true. Serving, cleansing, water of life, streams of 
living water, as the Bible says so often. Read Genesis alone and see how the 
wells are cherished. Life-nurturers. Without water in desert lands, death, 
Without God, death. Streams of living waters of Christ..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And the comfort of a hot bath at day's 
ending..... warming through and through on chill days.. Deep brown off the high 
peat bog... And the soul-nurturing of the Holy Wells with their purity and 
sanctity... </font></b></p>
</font>
<p></p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You my Lord through Brother Fire,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">through whom You light the night and he is 
beautiful and playful and robust and strong."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Turf from the high peat bogs, wood from living 
trees, coal-eggs from a local factory... Burning their generous heat, being 
consumed as they give of their essence.... kettles singing on the hearth, and 
that living comfort of flame and glow at day's end. The flicker of flame as I 
settle to sleep.....An old, old life, as new as each day's fire. And cats, lined 
up, as if hypnotised, staring unblinking into the living orange heart of the 
fire, in the rainy afternoons as I knit and pray.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You my Lord through our Sister,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Mother Earth</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">who sustains and governs us,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">producing varied fruits with coloured flowers 
and herbs."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Flowers still; glowing marigolds, nasturtiums, 
pastel sweet peas, and deeper hues of regal purple.... A few late roses, one by 
the door, others in the beds..... And, here, bags of apples and pears from the 
convent's trees. And the rich variety of jam and juice.. strawberry, gooseberry, 
blackberry, crap-apple... And the freezer still full of fruit and vegetables....
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And also shrubs and plants, and daffodil bulbs 
from the giving of friends. All to be colour and shape to joy the heart with the 
knowingness of God's providing And the promise of future growing as the ground 
is cleared for the polytunnel. And the trees! Again I am inebriated with the 
glow of them as I drive to Mass and the shops in this impossibly beautiful land 
where my Lord has brought me. The young ashes here started the month with acid 
green and yellow leaves, and their heavy keys deep brown; now they are bare, 
just the bare seeds</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">hanging down. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praise be You my Lord through those who grant 
pardon</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">for love of You and bear sickness and trial.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Blessed are those who endure in peace,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">By You Most High, they will be crowned."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And always, here, knowing of those who bear 
trouble in all its myriad torments. Praying with and for them.... Entrusting 
them not to human weak and fallible resources, but to Thy strength and light and 
love, Who alone art holy. See James....... "Patient endurance"; united with 
Jesus in His pain, bearing with gladness and with love, calm and tranquil.
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And not bearing grudges, not being angry, living 
as we need and seek to be loved, for love of He Who gave all for us. Who gave up 
this sweet and dancing life on earth at so young an age. Learning to love from 
Him. To forgive as He forgave. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praised be You, my Lord through Sister Death,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">from whom no-one living can escape.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Woe to those who die in mortal sin!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Blessed are they She finds doing Your Will.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">No second death can do them harm."</font></b></p>
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And always this; this ending of this part of our 
life.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">The first death; death to self when we live in 
Christ; loving Him and all around us more than we love ourselves; dying thus to 
"our" thoughts of fulfilment and ambitions. Thus doing His will, living as He 
did. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So that "second death" is the death of our 
mortal bodies. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Part of life, part of His work and His creation. 
To be faced and accepted open-faced. Strong in the trust of Him, witnessing and 
with integrity.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">"Praise and bless my Lord and give Him thanks,</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And serve Him with great humility. "</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">For only love humbles; not power, not 
aggression, not rules and regulations, or discipline. Simply, purely, wholly, 
love....... Humility is born of love, not of humiliation, of freedom, not of 
bondage. Of being faced with acceptance, not censure. The open arms of Jesus on 
the Cross, not clenched fists or folded arms... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Moses; humbled by seeing God's living power.. 
humbled before God, yet lambasting the errant Israelites....Humility, kneeling 
before Him in deep love and awe-ful thankfulness.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">There is an old, old story, of the wind and the 
sun vying to see who could make an old man take off his coat. It was an old, 
tattered coat, but all he had, and the plain he was crossing was wide and 
barren. So the wind blew, strong and cold. Oh, how he blew! He all but knocked 
the poor old man down with his force! But all the man did was pull his ragged 
old coat closer round him..... Finally the sun's turn came.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And she shone warm on that poor old man, strong, 
beneficent rays, glowing.... And the old man took off his shabby old coat, and, 
face raised to the</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">golden heat, lay down and slept, peaceful in 
warmth.... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">AMEN, AMEN and AMEN...</font></b></p>
