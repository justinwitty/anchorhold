<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">TALE OF THREE COCKERELS...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When I lived on the island, I 
learned the realities of the gulf between farmers and religious with strong 
Franciscan leaning......... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">This is what I wrote then.....
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">" I have a varied flock of hens, 
who like to hatch their eggs in true and natural fashion.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">There is no way to predict the 
sex of unhatched chicks, and in any farm etc there can basically only be one 
cockerel.. Apart from the noise ( they challenge each other by crowing back and 
forth, at a high rate of decibels) they will fight to the death, interbreed etc.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The usual "remedy" for spare 
cockerels in this "women's lib" setting is</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"the pot"... I am in consequence 
of having so many animal/bird friends, becoming more and more vegetarian, Meat 
simply became too personal... One of the main reasons was the annual cockerel 
cull.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I CANNOT kill, so a neighbour, 
tolerating this "soft",disabled Englishwoman, would come and collect the spares. 
I felt obliged to catch them; this can only be done at night, you see...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And they SCREAM!! Horrible 
noise!! And, being a kind Sister, would find myself comforting them "It's OK: 
no-one's going to........." And Ii would have to stop....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">All this rather spoilt my huge 
pleasure at hatching time.. Knowing what lay ahead....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And the pathetic scrawny 
corpses!! I could rarely bring myself to touch them; the cats had no such 
scruples!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Well, this year, after various 
events and attitudes here since I became the first and only Sister on a largely 
pagan/anti-Catholic island, I found the courage of my convictions</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I was NOT going to participate 
in discriminatory killing!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Accordingly, one night in Lent, 
I caught two of the spare cockerels, torch and pole in hand( torch to see 
swiftly who and where they were, and pole to knock them out of the rafters!) 
There was a third, but by then there was TOTAL CHAOS out there!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"NO-ONE IS GOING TO HARM YOU!!" 
I assured them with great glee..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Because this time it was true.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And in the pearl grey of the 
early morning, sacks wriggling in the back of the car, and singing a happy hymn, 
I drove to the shore nearest, where I watch the seals etc. The seaweed there, 
great banks of it, is heaving with grubs at that time of year; there is fresh 
water and the ruined house to shelter in. They would be FINE!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And with huge satisfaction I 
watched my two renegades lope off into the dawn...Wished them well and 
farewell..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">For various reasons, I did not 
get back to the shore for a while after that. Someone I had told about this ( 
NOT LOCAL!!) wondered if folk would guess the origin of these two.. I know these 
people and laughed. "Probably - but no-one would dare accuse me to my face!"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">We also wondered if they might 
"home" - but I have had spare cockerels</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"dumped" here (island humour!!) 
several times and once here they show no</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">inclination to go home...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Two days before I lost my 
cat-friend the neighbour who usually kills the cockerels rang me. This is a VERY 
rare event; I was punch -drunk with lack of sleep, so was not alert!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"Have you been down to the shore 
recently?"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I had explained I was ill, but!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"So you haven't seen those two 
roosters someone's put there, running about?"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I was very thankful we don't 
have videophone!! My first reaction, stifled just in time, was delight and 
relief. "The boys" were safe!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!" I exclaimed 
realistically, chuckling inwardly - and knowing full well she KNEW they were 
mine..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"CRUEL that", she opined, 
self-righteousness in every letter....(AND PULLING THE NECKS OF TERRIFIED BIRDS 
IS KIND???) "There's no food for them there"</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">It was then I in my joyful 
tiredness made an unguarded mistake. "Oh, I don't know! The seaweed is FULL of 
maggots..."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">You could have heard a pin 
drop.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">A few nights later I saw, 
through my uncurtained window, torchlight flashing.. No car, just the lights. 
This, in my isolated situation here ( the nearest house is about a quarter of a 
mile away) is very unusual.... But it was Saturday night, when the drink flows 
freely here and wise maidens stay put.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">As day dawned, the peace was 
shattered and rent by many crowings and chasings.. The boys were back! They 
patently did not want to be; they took off across the fields every time I 
appeared. Even while quite desperate about all this, I noticed how fit and well 
they looked! Any resemblance to a pampered barnyard cockerel had vanished. These</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">were wild creatures, long of 
leg, fleet Quite beautiful.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Obviously the life suited them!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">That day is one I will not 
easily forget.. The noise outside; five cockerels......</font></b></p>
</font><font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And my dilemma.... They KNEW 
those birds had come from here, my conservative neighbours who hate my 
"different ways".. So no way could I get rid of them in "their" way..I am VERY, 
VERY bad at lying, thankfully...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">So the long hours passed..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And a plan formed, for I was NOT 
going to be beaten back, out manoeuvred, thwarted in my mercy plans.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And I have a distinct tactical 
advantage over these folk - one that really annoys and disconcerts them by its 
"eccentricity". I sleep little and at unusual hours; my normal day starts at 
three am, so "the thin time" and I are dear friends....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">So, soon after midnight , there 
I was, torch, pole, sacks... energised by need, furtively creeping through the 
mud, watching for lights going on across the fields...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">My word they were stronger!! And 
LOUDER! They fought and struggled.... One sack "hopped" across the yard....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And I added the third one, 
leaving Coquelicot , my "boss-cock", and Hitler, the all- dancing, all crooning 
aggressive "spare" who is a from my original cockerel and genetically acceptable 
- and a comic I would miss...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And off I drove in the still, 
dark, blessedly solitary night...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">TACTICS!!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">This is a small island, about 6 
miles by 4, sparsely populated, and wild. The shore had simply been too confined 
a space ( even so they must have taken some catching... What malice!!)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">So now I drove clear across the 
island (I was at the south tip), up northerly, to the wild part that surrounds 
and abuts on our tiny airstrip, used only on Wednesdays... By one of the ruined 
chapels I stopped, hefted out the struggling sacks, and, one by one,, released 
the trio into the sweet, clean air of freedom.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">With HUGE satisfaction.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">That was on Mothering Sunday, 
English time, mid-Lent..... No calls, no cockerels.... Farmers, nil, Sister - 
HIGH SCORE..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">This year the hatchings have 
been especially joyful. For no matter what sex these tinies are, they are safe 
from sudden death....for next spring, they will join their siblings, living free 
in this fair and fertile land........ </font></b></p>
