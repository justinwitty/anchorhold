<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">The shore nearest to 
the island hermitage where I used to live was right </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">at the southern end of 
the island, less than a mile away.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">The narrowing road 
becomes grassy and peters out at the shore, ending in an exultation of freedom 
and splendour. It is a wild and lonely place, where sea meets land, unspoilt, 
clean. The pale sand, wet from the outgoing tide, is fretted with the tiny 
footprints of a myriad birds, strewn with tiny shells.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">And the sky is vast; 
always huge and never twice the same. Evanescent moods, changing, pulsing as the 
sea.. Living...Cloud scapes, dramatic, blue stretching out on rare smiling days 
of summer. Heavy, leaden, in gale-stormed winter......</font></b></p>
<font SIZE="4">
<p></p>
</font>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">Seals bask there in 
great numbers on the rocky, seaweed- covered skerries at low tide.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">I had been told that if 
you whistled, the seals would come..They are, you see, very curious creatures, 
and still relatively unafraid. I cannot whistle, so I tried singing, good 
Christian songs of course...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">But to no avail, so for 
many months, I had to content myself with these distant views.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">They are, I quickly 
learnt, incredibly noisy creatures. When you see the music-laden TV programmes, 
you do not realise that there is a raucous symphony of grunts and barks playing... 
In the still, clear air in calm weather small sound carries.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">On one pilgrimage to 
the shore, I walked gently along, joying in the air and the wide, wide sky, and 
the sheer freedom . And singing thanks and praise to Jesus, as is my solitary 
wont.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">Suddenly I had that 
unmistakable awareness that I was being watched... Stopping, I looked around - 
there was no one to be seen, and there are no bushes here to conceal anyone... My 
puzzled gaze then turned to the sea -and close in to shore were a good number of 
huge-eyed, whiskered faces - the seals had come to listen to my thanksgiving 
&quot;concert.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">It made an already 
wondrous occasion totally enchanted.. I sat there on the sand and sang...And the 
heads came closer; tails appeared too as they settled and relaxed.. And when I 
finally tore myself away it was with a very full heart..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">This was the beginning 
of a rich time for me...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">In my homebound time, I 
had often dreamed, quite literally, of a path along the shore, and wondered if 
it was real. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">And I knew a path ran 
along the shore.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">So, one day, I decided 
to find out. I parked the car as near as I could, then walked along the rough 
and rutted path - to find I was being followed, in the water, by a seal.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">At first I thought it 
was just coincidence.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">But every time I 
stopped, so did the seal, and when I resumed my walk, he </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">began to swim along 
near the shore again...It was for all the world like</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">taking the dog for a 
walk...He looked paler than the other seals; they</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">were all basking in 
their usual place, further back.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">A good way along, I 
went down on to the rocks to rest a while.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">The seal came in only a 
matter of feet from me and stayed there for the half hour I was there.. He was 
indeed white, but adult.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">At these times, you can 
understand all the ancient legends about the seal people who emerge form the 
water at night and shed their skins. I would not have been surprised if he had 
spoken...and leaped out on to the rocks.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">I saw that particular 
seal many times since and he was often by himself.. Maybe simply his 
difference...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">Frequently when I go 
down to the shore, there is not a seal in sight, especially at higher tides when 
the skerries where they bask are submerged. But I have only to call, or begin to 
sing, and all the heads pop up; they come in so close to me.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">Often, on cold, windy 
days, they lie with just their whiskered snouts visible, pointing skywards. 
Warmer thus....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">I now always wait for a 
while, before I call, s till hardly able to believe that they will really come 
at the sound of my voice.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">One day I looked up to 
see a neighbour watching, astounded at all this. We share a deep respect for and 
love of these controversial creatures; the local fishermen claim they ruin their 
nets and steal THEIR fish... Seals are now protected by law, but this does not 
meet with uniform approval. A few years ago, several baby seals, defenceless and 
helpless, were clubbed to death on an island beach. A local seal rescue place, 
which does sterling work, has been threatened with violence, gunshots fired. 
There is, if well-managed, plenty for us all - and oh, the loss, if these wild, 
free creatures of God were destroyed. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4" color="#000099">A friend there; she 
recalls eating &quot;selkie&quot;. Indeed in earlier times there was probably a real need 
for any meat that was available, especially in the winter. The diet then must 
have been so restricted.</font></b></p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p></p>
</font><font size="4">
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But those times, thankfully, 
have passed, and we can now make more civilised choices. As I told her, they eat 
dogs in China.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">For me, the most exciting and 
magical time was then yet to be...Something I had never expected...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">One day in early November, I 
went along the right side of the shore for a change, rock-stepping as I love. 
The huge rocks are bright and varied in their colours, smooth from aeons of 
tide-tossing...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Many are also very slippery, so 
I was proceeding very cautiously, and totally engrossed in my feet. </font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">It was thus a considerable shock 
when the rock I was about to step onto snarled and moved.. and I found myself 
gazing into the huge, liquidly dark eyes of a baby seal... I could not believe it! 
This was an answer to unuttered prayer, to see one of these creatures so close.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And oh, he was even more 
beautiful than I could have imagined... Pure white fur, sleek and soft-looking And 
his mouth more full of vicious-looking teeth than I would have thought possible!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Retreating to the bank, I 
debated what to do; my initial feelings were protective; there is as I have 
said, a lot of hostility to the seals from the fishing fraternity up here. They 
are protected in law, but things can happen on an off-island and never be known...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">My first thought was that this 
was where this baby should be; safe from predating fishermen. I had a thick 
blanket in the car, and I sat on the bank with this while I thought about it. I 
had not realised the size of these babies! Or their fierceness; those teeth are 
formidable. I decided I did not know enough to deal with this situation. So I 
returned to the hermitage to phone for advice. ... There was no answer from the 
Seal Rescue number, but the local radio station suggested the SSPCA.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">&gt;From whom I learned so much.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">As I told them, there were two 
adult seals in the water nearby. So it was likely that there was no immediate 
problem. Apparently baby seals do not go into the water for the first two weeks, 
so this was probably a newborn. Certainly there was not a speck of black on that 
glorious white coat. That, too, changes after a couple of weeks. I was advised 
to keep an eye on it.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">That evening, and very early the 
following morning I went down to the shore again; the seal had moved a couple of 
hundred yards along the rocks. The two seals were still there in the water just 
off the shore.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Their mobility is amazing. They 
look, with no feet, so ungainly. All they can do is rock..Their tails are almost 
prehensile, expressive, with digits, levering them along effectively enough, but 
slowly, on their reluctant land journeyings. And once in the water! Their speed 
and agility ! </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Watching them leap and dive with 
a reckless zest and freedom joys and tugs at the heart.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Later that day, I went down 
again, as the tide was coming in; at first I thought he was dead, and my heart 
misgave me.. then when I came near, he woke up suddenly... It was a mild, quiet 
day, so, intrigued, I hid behind some rocks, made myself comfortable and 
invisible, and kept very, very still. So still that a tiny, neat, dapper wren 
all but landed on my shoe.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The mother seal kept looking for 
him, coming out of the water at different places.. Finally she seemed to realise 
where he was, and simply kept vigil.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When the incoming tide touched 
the baby seal ,he set up a loud, distressed-sounding wailing, an eerie and 
soul-rending sound.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Immediately the mother surged 
out of the water - only to be knocked back by the bigger seal. This intrigued 
and puzzled.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When the water was high around 
the baby, the mother came out and began to suckle him.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">All this was a very few feet 
from where I lay, in rapidly growing darkness. It was a sharing in something so 
intimate, almost holy. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And it was then I left, as the 
night made all invisible.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">It was a wild, stormy night, and 
first light saw me anxiously driving back to the shore.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The tide was very high, and 
there were the seal and its mother; the baby</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">was trying to get out of the 
water, hard up against the rocks, and looked</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">in distress.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I came back to phone again for 
advice, and this time the seal sanctuary answered. And filled in the huge gaps 
in my knowledge...Listening to him talk was wondrous. His love and expertise shine 
out . Apparently the bigger of the two waterborne seals was the bull; after 
mating, the fertilised eggs lie dormant for three months. So the bull was trying 
to mate with the mother - as she was seeking to nurture her existing pup.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">As I had known, seal milk is 
very rich in fat. I was able to assure</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">him that the baby was not 
injured, and was well- covered and vigorous.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">He told me too, that, as I had 
surmised, some seal pups get rescued when, as with &quot;mine&quot;, they are fine...I had, 
thankfully, done the right thing....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I only saw the pup once more, 
then it vanished back into the sea, </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">hopefully to grow strong and 
well.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The seals are a part of this 
place; it is, simply, theirs. Not ours. There is a children's song, haunting, 
poignant; "Think of a world without any flowers. " And I think thus about these 
huge, gentle and playful creatures, caught in time between sea and land. Without 
them, it would be a cold and barren </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">world indeed.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">They give a timeless, eternal 
dimension to a world that is racing too fast draw us back to the slow and 
healing rhythms of God. Remind us of realities that are too easily ignored else.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And, even when the weather or 
illness prevent my going to that wild, free place, my heart and soul know it, 
and they, are there, living as God made them.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">"Yonder is the great and wild 
sea with its living things too many to number, creatures both great and 
small....All of them look to you to give them their food in due season..You give 
it to them; they gather it; You open Your hand, and they are filled with good 
things." Psalm 104, verses26:28-29 </font></b></p>
