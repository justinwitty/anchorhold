<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Chiquita; a healing.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">A few weeks ago, I sent a 
dramatic photo to friends - a small cat high on the ridge of a roof, silhouetted 
against a huge, cloud-scattered sky...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">This was Chiquita in exuberant 
mood, on the roof of an outbuilding, a few years ago.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">She has not been up to climbing 
for some while now. I have watched her growing thin and tired, just as Tiger did 
in her last months. And knowing that her time with me I had thus determined to 
enjoy it and her to the full...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Chiquita is a pretty cat, three 
parts Siamese, blue - eyed, and unusually marked. She is dainty and small-boned, 
and fits so well on my lap. Unlike the boys, she is gentle and quiet there, a 
comforting and not-too-heavy presence.. And the last of the females.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When, one morning in mid-August, 
2001, I went as usual to feed the cats, she was unable to move from the sleeping 
box..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">My heart plummeted. I had not 
expected this for some weeks yet. I gathered her up into my arms, limp, silent, 
and so light. And swallowed my heartbreak to care for her last hours.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I prayed, and I asked many 
others to pray, mostly that her passing would be easy; Tiger's was hard and I 
needed different for her.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Because she WAS dying. I have 
lived closely with these lovely creatures for around thirty years, and the signs 
are unmistakable. Once a cat goes as far down that road as Chiquita had, there 
is no turning back.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I had her mother and her 
grandmother; Both died at around this age, or younger, just seeming to stop 
fighting. I took her grandmother, Mrs Tiggywinkle, to the vet; he saw that she 
was dying, that there was nothing he or anyone could do. Mrs Tiggywinkle had 
been far less ill than Chiquita now was.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I kept Chiquita close that day. 
It was warm enough to sit outside, so she was on my lap then. Tiger used always 
to "claim" the place across my heart; Chiquita misses her, searches for her 
still ( which may be part of her succumbing thus) and has claimed that place. So 
I kept her there, against me, giving her all the love I could as she worsened. 
Her nose was hot and dry; she was unresponsive, just occasionally moving her 
head when I rubbed it as she loved. Her eyes were sunken and glazed, her coat 
felt dead - and when later I transferred her to my bed, she was incontinent, and 
too far gone to notice or care.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Just dying, little by little.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">That night I kept her in my bed, 
well-padded with plastic sheeting and old towels. She would not, of course, eat 
or drink; I droppered a little water into her mouth - she could only tolerate 
tiny amounts. And I kept her within the curve of my body, talking, praying. 
Whenever I took my hands off her, her breathing grew worse. Yes, I asked God to 
spare her; I would miss this one so much, especially after losing Tiger earlier 
this year. Prayed SO STRONGLY - but always that her passing would be easy for 
her. Sometimes loving means doing this...relinquishing.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">In the early hours of that long 
night, the "thin time" when my prayer-day usually begins formally, Chiquita 
suddenly started purring..... And, after being stretched out unnaturally all 
night, she curled up into her familiar, neat ball, tail wrapped over her black 
nose, and slept...purring loudly. I was told then that cats often purr in pain - 
but this was not that! This was normal activity .</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Punch-drunk with lack of sleep, 
I did not know what to think - was too drained to think at all.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But from then on her recovery 
was phenomenal. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">A short while later, as I was in 
the kitchen she came to find me - very wobbly, and looking emaciated. BUT 
PURRING LOUDLY!! I made up rehydration liquid, thinking that if she DID live a 
while longer I was going to be nursing a VERY sick cat...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I had craft work spread out on 
the floor; Chiquita delighted in weaving in and out of it all, back arched, tail 
across my face, always purring loudly, eyes bright and full. If a cat CAN laugh, 
Chiquita was chuckling that day... and I got precious little done for marvelling 
at her..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Her nose and ears cooled rapidly 
- and, after refusing cat food, she consented to eat a little tuna.. And among 
all the doubting and incredulous reactions, it became joyously </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">and unmistakably clear in a very 
few hours that Chiquita was ebulliently well.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And full of spirit, of life, of 
sheer zest in life, seeming to know that something very special had happened to 
her...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The days have lengthened into 
weeks now; the cat I have now is not the fading, failing old lady of recent 
months. This is the "old" Chiquita, kittenish, lively.... She races crazily up 
and down the corridor in her Siamese way, rolls on her back in pools of 
sunlight.. Eats voraciously, and is putting weight on. And she purrs!! Loud and 
long..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">There seems to be no trace of 
illness in her.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">There is no other explanation 
but that she was suddenly and dramatically healed. I have never seen HEALING 
like this before, not so unequivocal, with no other explanation possible. Oh 
there have been "possibles"!!! The sheep's feet that time, and a tiny, very 
disabled peachick that was given back to me from death for a few days. Long 
enough for it to have some time in the sun - and for me to accept that it was 
too deformed to live..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But, rationally as we are in 
this age, "brainwashed" , there was always a "Well, maybe..." That is not a 
possible here; she was dying. And 36 hours with no food, barely any liquid...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I delight in her; she seems to 
know she has been given back, and I hardly need to ask where she was or who she 
was with in those absent hours; it shines out of her.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">My thankfulness as she sneaks 
into the airing cupboard or races pellmell up and down the long corridor knows 
no bounds; I needed her, and God-wh-loves knew that. Praise His Holy Name!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Postscript.......</font></b></p>

Ireland.......We come full circle....</font></b></p>
