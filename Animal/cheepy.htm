<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Cheepy, an island tale</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">In my third year here, I bought 
in some Black Rocket pullets from a neighbouring island, to add to my stock. 
They were already used to the outdoors and fiercely independent.; no lap or 
shoulder birds these! Fine big birds; a neighbour assured me they would lay 
&quot;deep broon&quot; eggs - as indeed they did. And still do......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Their plumage was black, with 
some russet; their feet repelled me. Black and scaly! Reminding of their 
reptilian streak....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">One of them insisted on laying 
in the flourishing bed of the striped ornamental grass under my bedroom window; 
after some weeks of this, she began to show all the signs of going broody, so I 
gathered up a day''s eggs at random and put them in her nest. A clucky hen is a 
very valuable creature up here. Whether you want table birds or more chickens, 
this, after all, is the only way, even in this age of technological wonders, 
that you can get hens.. Or eggs for that matter......Oh, you can use an incubator, 
but it is just not the same......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">It was a great comfort to me 
those weeks, as I lay sleepless with the window wide open to the sweet, wild 
night air, to hear the tiny chinking in the small hours as the black hen turned 
the eggs with that unerring and mysterious instinct. The smell when you get 
close is the worst in the world –– which is why you keep your distance. Which is 
the purpose of the smell.. No self-respecting predator is going to go near 
something that smells so utterly FOUL....... Another of the wonderful provisions in 
creation for the continuity of life.......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Now, I and others have found 
that hens, especially untried ones, are not very skilful when it comes to the 
actual hatching; the idea of a tiny bird dying in the shell is unthinkable. In 
previous years I had thus &quot;helped&quot; and intended to do so this time...... A hen''s 
forceful peck can bruise, This hen was certainly fierce......But I braved it at 
intervals on that hatching day...... There were tiny black chicks; one had already 
been crushed to death against the unhatched eggs, so I extracted those eggs that 
were still whole, leaving her to brood her chicks......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Indoors, I simply listened! The 
sound of the tapping and tiny cheeping from inside an egg is a miracle I never 
weary of. Over the next day and night, I helped the chicks out, then returned 
them to the brood; this at first confuses the hen, but she soon changes from 
hostility to nurturing.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">There were a couple of eggs 
left; I was reluctant to throw them away, if there were any chance of a life in 
them, so I gave them just one more night under the lamp (a small reading light 
with a flexible neck).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">In the morning there was a faint 
tapping from one......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">It was so faint that I judged 
the chick was in difficulties, so carefully cracked the shell. This is 
difficult; if you get the timing wrong the chick dies. If you leave it too late, 
the chick dies.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I thought at first that I had 
been premature. But I soldiered on. Keeping the chick moist. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">There is nothing quite so 
primeval as a hatching chick.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">They lie curled so tightly in 
their nurturing shells, one huge claw over their head.. Huge bulging eyes. And 
still wet. No pretty fluffy creatures, until the breath of life has filled them 
out, and the air dried their straggly covering.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">This chick took so long to 
gather any strength; they have enough nourishment still in them from the yolk 
sac for about 48 hours. After a couple of days, he had rallied enough, I judged, 
to be restored to his family. I had no wish, and was simply not well enough, to 
adopt a tame chicken!</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">As it was I had been up for a 
night or two, and all I needed was to sleep......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">The chick was thoroughly 
delighted to go to his natural mother; although I had gathered eggs at random, 
all the hatched chicks were black. Except this one, who was a pale yellow... 
Baby chicks grow so swiftly. His siblings were by now two days ahead of him, two 
vital days that are a long while in their lives.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I watched the saga unfold from 
the doorstep. The grass was long, as I had been too ill to cut it. Mother hen 
would lead her chicks; she would find a tasty morsel, and call to them in that 
husky, throaty way. The black chicks would scurry to her. Devour the morsel. And 
in the van, game, valiant, but hopelessly outrun, there would be the tiny yellow 
chick.. By the time he got there, the food was eaten, and the group, was moving 
on to the next feed..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I tried to remedy this by 
feeding them, of course. But every time, the story was the same. The sheer spunk 
of that chick! He never gave up trying.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I deemed that he would be fine 
at nights, safely under the hen.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But the mist and a soaking 
drizzle came in. One night I was woken ( the nights here are very short in the 
summer, so I was in bed way before the</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">chickens) by a plaintive and 
incredibly loud cheeping......It went on and on, the epitome of terror and need. So, 
I pulled myself out of bed, dragged on a cardigan and fetched the torch...... It 
took me a long time to trace the sound; I was so near, but I just could not find 
the chick...... By now, the sleeve of my cardigan was soaked through, from searching 
in the tall grass, and an uncomfortable wet chill was seeping through it onto my 
back from the drizzle. And still no chick. Eventually the torch beam fell on 
this tiny yellow, bedraggled scrap of fluff, firmly wedged in a tuft of grass.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I carried him into the kitchen, 
where the box and lamp still stood at the ready. He was SOAKED! Drying him off 
as best as I could, I put him on the sweet dry grass under the lamp. He was 
shivering so hard he kept falling over, poor scrap...... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">All I could do was leave him to 
recover –– and find dry nightclothes..</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">In the morning there he was, 
cheeping away, full of life and joy,, ready for food and goat's milk......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">A neighbour told me that if I 
wasn''t careful, I would find myself with &quot;a very silly chicken&quot;! But it was 
said with such affection! Obviously she was speaking from a happy experience.. 
And what choice here?</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">A pattern emerged; every morning 
I would put him outside with the other chicks – then at night I found I needed 
to bring him in for safety. He took a few days to recover fully from his 
soaking, and every morning I would pad down the corridor, heart in my mouth, 
expecting to find a pathetic little corpse. And every morning there would be the 
sunshine of his enthusiastic cheeping to greet me.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I had until then no idea of how 
wide a chick''s verbal repertoire is; they have a song all of their own. &quot;I am 
ALIVE! I love life! Isn''t it wonderful? BE HAPPY!&quot; There are trills and scales, 
a veritable aria of song! And this tiny creature''s joi de vivre and enthusiasm 
were so infectious.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Oh, I went on making very 
sincere efforts to keep him in his chicken world......After a couple of weeks, I 
decided it was time the chicks were in the back with the other hens. Their 
depredations on the few flowers I had and on the even fewer vegetables I had 
managed to plant were getting very serious. This was before I had the excellent 
coop made, so I improvised a netting enclosure, resolutely gathered all the 
chicks up in a bucket and, with the black hen squawking away, carried them 
through the house and into the back. I put them all in, then went back and 
caught the hen. FINE!! This, I reasoned, was after all better for Cheepy he was 
bigger now and I could still keep a close eye on him...... To this day I have no 
idea how he got out of the coop. None of the other chicks managed it. But there 
he was at the back door, cheeping indignantly....... Yes, I now had a very, very 
silly chicken....... And I was charmed and delighted at this awesome 
responsibility......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Motherhood to an &quot;unclaimed 
treasure &quot; as I was then, is to be taken very seriously, you must realise. Here 
I was, now the sole supporter of a frail and tiny chick......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">That summer we had long periods 
of clear skies and hot sunshine for the hay-making..The sounds and smells are 
still so strong in my memory.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I was not well enough to do very 
much, but to lie on the sun-baked grass was sheer bliss.. And wherever I went, 
Cheepy came too, When I slept out there in the balmy days, he snuggled up in the 
crook of my elbow, crooning and chirping. His happiness revolved around being as 
close to me as possible. When I tried a little light gardening, which for me was 
to sit on the ground with a small trowel, Cheepy thought this was solely for HIS 
benefit. After all, this was behaviour he understood with every chicken 
instinct. The mother hen scratching for food for him...... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When I had been to the shore, he 
would run flapping to greet the car, ecstatic, and perch on my arm like a 
falcon. When I got up in the morning, he was on the doorstep; if I was late, he 
would cheep indignantly. All this is tremendously healing.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When you feel too ill to be any 
use to any living creature, and a tiny young thing attaches itself limpet-like 
to you, it reaches to your very soul. His total dependence, emotionally and 
physically, awed and delighted. As his feathers grew in, it was clear he was 
going to be pure white, a throwback to some distant ancestor......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But summers end.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">When he grew very big, I deemed 
it fairer to accustom him to life with the other chickens. A chicken inside the 
house is a daunting thought.. So, into the back he went. There was some initial 
pecking from the other hens, (they distrust strangers), but this soon resolved. 
It was so hard to let him go like this! After a while I really thought he had 
totally forgotten me and this was not easy! Then one day as I was filling the 
peat buckets, there he was, scratchng around where I was collecting, with that 
old expression in his eyes, wanting to be tickled......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">He was huge, a fine white 
cockerel, and I was so proud of him......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But winter comes early here; at 
the end of October we had a very wet and cold spell. One day he was limping 
badly. I waited to see if he would cope. The next day there was no white 
cockerel out there, and my heart nearly stopped. I searched out in the rain, a 
reminder of seeking him on that earlier night. And found him, under the 
portacabin, unable to walk. So, it was back into a cardboard box in the kitchen, 
with sweet dry hay, a pot of milk and a dish of food. He was ecstatic at this! 
Cheeping and eating greedily! And it was so comforting to have him there again. 
I kept trying to get him to walk, with no success. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I knew what the outcome was to 
be.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">And one morning I came in to the 
kitchen, to a stillness. It is a strange and unmistakable quietness, this 
absence of life when death has visited.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Cheepy was there, head under his 
wing. He had simply fallen asleep......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">I duly buried him where all my 
treasured friends lie, in the sheltered patch just outside the garden looking 
out over the sea, with rosa rugosas bending over, and the sweet birdsong and 
moonlight. Probably he was never in nature''s way &quot;meant&quot; to live; there was a 
weakness, a flaw –– which is why he needed help even to hatch.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">But he had such a blissfully 
happy little life! Just four months, and he had given so much in that time, of 
joy and of love.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">Not a bad record for an egg........</font></b></p>
