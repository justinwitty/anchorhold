<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">2: Then she runneth, 
and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and

not where they have laid Him. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">3: Peter therefore 
went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">4: So they ran both 
together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the 
sepulchre. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">5: And he stooping 
down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. </font>

Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen

that was about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together 
in a place by itself. </font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">8: Then went in 
also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and

knew not the scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. </font></b></p>

without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked

thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. </font></b></p>

Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into 
the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.

are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">30: And many other 
signs truly did Jesus in the presence of Hhis disciples, which are not written 
in this book: </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">1: After these 
things Jesus shewed Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and 
on this wise shewed He Himself. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">2: There were 
together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in 
Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of His disciples. </font></b>
</p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">3: Simon Peter 
saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They 
went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught 
nothing. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">4: But when the 
morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that 
it was Jesus. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>

unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered Him, No. </font></b></p>

them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast 
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
</font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">7: Therefore that 
disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter 
heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was 
naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">8: And the other 
disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it 
were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">9: As soon then as 
they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, 
and bread. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">10: Jesus saith 
unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">11: Simon Peter 
went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty 
and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. </font>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">12: Jesus saith 
unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask Him, Who art thou? 
knowing that it was the Lord. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">13: Jesus then 
cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">14: This is now the

<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">15: So when they 
had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more

saith unto him, Feed My lambs. 16: He saith to him again the second time, Simon, 
son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I 
love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">17: He saith unto 
him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved 
because He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou Me? And He said unto him, 
Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto 
him, Feed My sheep. </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">18: Verily, verily, 
I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst 
whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy 
hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
</font></b></p>

<CENTER>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">19: This spake He,

saith unto him, Follow Me. </font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Poor Richard" color="#000099">20: Then Peter, 
turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned 
on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth Thee? </font>

what is that to thee? </font></b></p>

<CENTER>
