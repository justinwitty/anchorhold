<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Mayo is fairly littered with old abbeys.....Moyne 
is one such, and Franciscan too... It lies snug in a cleft in the shore of a 
deep estuary, between Killala and Ballina, some thirty miles from here. As you 
drive down the lane, between flower-strewn hedges, even with the clutter of 
modern bungalows, there is an ancient feel to the countryside. The small hills 
look terraced.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">History briefly tells that Moyne Abbey was 
consecrated in 1462. Then burnt down by the British governor of Connaught a 
century or so later. and the monks persecuted . But there were monks there in 
some form until the late 19th century. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It lies across fields, and, as I saw on an 
earlier attempt to see it on my way to Knock, the right of way lies across very 
hostile territory. The farmer blocks the path with a secure gate, and big 
notices, "BEWARE OF THE BULL" and "NO TRESPASSING" </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">This time I was determined. This is a Franciscan 
holy place; part of our spiritual inheritance.. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So I made a cautious journey across cattled 
fields.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And there I was, in the shadow of Moyne Abbey... 
And walking up the driveway and through the great arched door. It was only the 
day after that I realised why I had thought it had no great immediate impact. It 
was, simply, where it is natural for a religious to be. Our natural environment. 
Home... I so long to know more; where the secular gravestones lying all over the 
ruins came from... And have learned since that in Ireland, old holy houses are a 
chosen burial ground for loved ones....</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It is a vast complex. Refectory, chapel and a 
maze of smaller rooms on two levels. The great tower; and perfect cloisters. All 
roofless now.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">I am not one who has any archeological interest. 
It is the spirit of a place that speaks to me. And when I looked at the tower, I 
could sense the violence and terror. For I think that these towers ( there is a 
round tower at nearby Killala I saw later, with links with St Patrick. The door 
is some 12 feet off the ground. Perfect to take refuge in.) were for safety 
against attack. Men of peace, and so soon after Saint Francis, attacked for no 
reason. I need to learn more here.. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">But they lived and worked and prayed here; and 
it is a good, strong, practical house of prayer. So I prayed my Offices there. 
As it was Ascension day, the psalms were of Sunday. I had missed two offices as 
I had had essential shopping to do, so I read the w hole of psalm 119 aloud 
there. And it felt good to add to the centuries of Franciscan prayer that have 
permeated those sturdy stone walls.. Then, I paced the cloisters, praying the 
Franciscan Crown. And it was fine and strong with swallows twittering atop the 
walls.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Outside, there are simple wooden Stations of the 
Cross. Just plain crosses marked with a black number. So I made the Stations, 
out in the sweet, cool, grey air. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Some of the crosses had fallen over. So, 
lovingly, I righted them. The second had been broken. It felt very, very 
poignant fitting the cross piece back on. And that simple liturgy took on for me 
that day a meaning it has never had before. The prayers I needed came to my lips 
from the depths of my being. And over the fence, two donkeys watched, with their 
gentle, wise old eyes, their backs forever marked with His Cross.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Oh, Moyne! I long for you to be alive with 
prayer again. To be lived in, and inhabited by religious. Not alone out there, 
unvisited and unvalued. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">May my prayers here ache into your eternity.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So the abbey rests in peace there. Ancient, 
steeped in the prayer and</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">struggle that is the heart of Christ. </font>
