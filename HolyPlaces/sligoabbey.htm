<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Sligo Abbey is in a busy town centre, and is the 
first, and so far only, old religious house I have been to that charges 
admission... Most are deep in the countryside.... So it has a Visitors' Centre 
and a lot of information. And is, in summer, busy with, as T.S . Eliot expresses 
it in "Murder in the Cathedral, speaking about Canterbury , " tourists with 
guide-books looking over it." </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Mostly Americans, in Ireland seeking their 
roots.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It was founded in 1252 0r 1253 by Maurice 
Fitzgerald, who also founded Sligo Town. And was in fact a Dominican Friary. The 
leaflet expresses the difference as follows. "‘Friar preachers' reside in a 
friary, whereas ‘monks' live in an abbey. Friars invited the public to worship 
in their church and went on preaching pilgrimages. In contrast, public access to 
abbeys was restricted and monks generally confined their vocation to worship 
through prayer and meditation."</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">These definitions overlap, of course, but it 
explains the location in the town centre, rather than out in the country; town 
friars needed not to grow their own food......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">One of the photos I took shows the O'Connor 
Sligo monument of 1642, built into the south wall of the choir. This 
commemorates Sir Donagh O'Connor, Lord of Sligo, and his wife, Lady Elinor 
Butler... They kneel in devout pose within a triumphal arch housing. Renaissance 
symbolism and symmetry</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">govern the decorative elements, and features 
include..crucifixion with</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">saints, coat of arms and symbols of death and 
the afterlife. It was O'Connor's influence with Queen Elizabeth which saved 
Sligo friary from dissolution, a fate suffered by a majority of the Irish 
catholic religious houses in the 16th century...</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">See Moyne and Rosserk.. And Creevelea... and 
many others... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">So the secular saves and supports the religious. 
And thus is honoured.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">But.... the British have an appalling record in 
this country.....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">The friary suffered much damage over the 
centuries. In 1642, the armies of Sir Frederick Hamilton, a Cromwellian soldier, 
attacked Sligo Town, causing significant damage to the friary. An edict of 
banishment was imposed on the friars in 1698 when the property was seized under 
the agency of the Crown.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And not just the British....</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">In the early 18th century, a local merchant 
named Thomas Corcoran, quarried the friary for building materials to construct 
town houses nearby. Despite all this, the friars were in residence up unto the 
1760s, after which they relocated to another friary nearby and the Order is 
still in town today.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Another fine carving is the O'Crean monument ( 
see photos). Dated 1506, it is decorated in typical medieval style. It has a 
peaked canopy with ornate tracery. The tomb chest is carved with figures beneath 
cusped arches and floral ornament. From left to right..St Dominic, St Catherine 
( with sword and wheel), a female saint(?), the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, St 
John, St Michael the Archangel( with sword and wings), St Peter( with key) and 
an Archbishop(?St Patrick?).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And the 15th century stone High Altar is the 
only sculptured example to survive in any monastic church. The front panelling 
is finely carved with foliage ornament, grapes and a rose. It is against the 
wall so the priest would have faced east......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">The graveyard history is interesting, especially 
after Creevelea. It was in continual use as a graveyard throughout its history. 
Both the grounds and the friary interior became the official town cemetery in 
the 18th century, and the friary ground level has been raised several feet to 
accommodate further burials........</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It is "interesting" in many ways to have so much 
detailed information...And to see it well-maintained ( there was work going on 
there that day) But to see a place of worship, holy ground, become only a 
secular historical site? Simply wandering at will, I walked the cloisters in 
reverence, for such are my soul-home. And never spared a thought for 
architectural features... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Interesting then an encounter - several times - 
with a young American man. He had come to Ireland with a plan to see all the 
High Crosses, but had realised that in the time he had, that was an impossible 
scheme... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">I met him again by the High Alter, and we 
talked. About prayer... he is a non-practising Jew, bored by it all - and by 
everything, world weary, Seeing this as a place that had "served its purpose"; 
and that all faith-traditions are the same. Bored, apathetic - and I wondered 
then why</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">travel all that way just to see High Crosses?
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">When he left, I knelt there before that High 
Altar, where Christ's sacrifice had been so many times over so many centuries, 
in thus a place sacred for all eternity, and prayed for him for conversion and 
thus for peace and happiness........... </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">And in those minutes I knelt there, in a busy, 
in a thronging town centre, no-one came in and I heard no voices. There was 
silence and stillness. And, thinking back, that space and that time and that 
sacredness entered deep within me and coloured my thoughts as I went on my way, 
shopping. I felt love reaching out to everyone I saw, that deep compassion I 
know is not of me.. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Nothing can take sacredness, holiness away; no 
human agency, no tourist information. For it is of God, and eternal and 
indestructible......He and</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">His love live on and hallow and sanctify every 
town and street. </font></b></p>
