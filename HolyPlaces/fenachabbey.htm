<p><b><font face="Poor Richard" size="4">Fenagh is a tiny village.The ruins fill 
it. And, as so often, in Ireland, where the dead are held dear, the old holy 
place is filled and surrounded by a still-used graveyard.<br>
The general view shows this well. On a fine autumn day.<br>
The &quot;holy family&quot; engraving is one of the gravestones. There were many really 
beautiful ones at Fenagh.<br>
There was also a lovely &quot;Mary&quot; shrine. And a moving carving of the Crucifixion..<br>
The nave is barred off, sadly. So it was not possible to enter and pray within 
the abbey. A great loss to a pilgrim.<br>
Also a view across the fields to the other part of the abbey. I was not suitably 
shod that day to expore further.... Maybe next time.....<br>
**********************************************<br>
This monastery is one of the most ancient monastic sites in Ireland. Its origins 
are obscure, but they go back to the earliest days of Celtic monasticism. The 
founder was St. Caillin who was supposed to have arrived in Fenagh from Dunmore 
in Co. Galway in the 5th century (according to the Book of Fenagh). He was given 
his monastic site by the head of the local princely family of Ua Ruairc 
(O'Rourke), of which family in turn he became the ecclesiastical patron. The 
Abbey had a famous monastic school. An editor of the 'Annals of the Four 
Masters' (one of writers, Peregrine O'Duigenan, was from Castlefore in Fenagh) 
stated that the monastery at Fenagh was &quot;celebrated for its divinity school, 
which was resorted to by students from every part of Europe&quot;.<br>

A ruined late medieval church of St.Caillin on the site of an early christian 
monastery founded by St.Caillin. Note its beautiful rose window.<br>
Nearby is another ruin most likely residential accommodation for the priests of 
Fenagh. The abbey was used for a time for Protestant worship until the present 
church was built nearby in circa 1798. About two miles from Ballinamore, it is 
steeped in history. It was the site of an abbey from the fifth o sixth 
century.The present day abbey ruins date from the fifteenth century and are well 
worth a visit.</font></b></p>
