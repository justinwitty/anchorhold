Rosserk Abbey lies near Ballina in County Mayo, reached down maze of leafy 
lanes. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It is Franciscan, having been built in 1460 for 
a group of Third Order Franciscans, who, being unable to be monks and nuns 
because they were married, still wanted to live in a monastic community. Rosserk, 
like so many abbeys, is in a setting of great natural beauty, in a sheltered sea 
estuary amid fertile land. Practical, of course, as they could then be 
self-sufficient; fishing and farming...... Sadly, it was, like Moyne, burnt down 
by the compatriot I heartily disown, the then Governor of Connaught, who 
similarly torched nearby Moyne Abbey, around 1590.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">It must have been a dramatic and dreadful scene; 
riders with great blazing torches, galloping along the tranquil, leafy lanes, 
destroying the prayerful silence, and bringing havoc and violence to the 
cloisters.... And the flames leaping high, hell's ministers, as night fell, the 
brethren homeless, the sacred places desecrated.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Now, it lies open to the skies, the magnificent 
arched window in the church all the more stark in its simply beauty. A complex, 
complete monastery; full now as all these holy places are in Ireland, with more 
recent graves and gravestones. Stairs and passages, windows, rooms. All their 
life and living there. Both times I have been there, there has been one other 
car there - and both times that has belonged to a French family..... The man 
this time had a French guide book, and asked if I knew this place, and if so, 
could I show him where the &quot;piscine&quot; was - with carving and Gothic arches. I was 
puzzled; a piscine is usually a swimming pool! So that was what they were 
looking for... In a 15th century monastery.......</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Then realisation came, and I led them to the 
church; Rosserk has a rare double basin near the altar for washing the sacred 
communion vessels..... Complete with carvings of angels, and intricate stone 
arches.. ( see photo) And on the right hand side, a small and very old lion 
carving I had not noticed last time.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">Let us never take freedom to pray for granted; 
nor let us persecute and exile those who pray differently from us. Let us not 
burn each others prayer-places.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">For we answer not to man, but to God Himself for 
all we thus harm and exile and wound, for all His prophets we turn out of the 
camp, as man did to Jesus.Amen, amen and amen</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Poor Richard">PS I have to admit to having nursed a very sore 
head; I failed to duck in a stone doorway.. I know they say that people were 
shorter in those days, but I remain sure that this one one way of teaching 
monastic humility:) It certainly, as I was moving fast, brought me to my knees, 
literally, in a daze of &quot;What happened?&quot; Hard stone; hard lessons.......</font></b></p>
