			Living Stream Sisters of Faith works to "feed the hungry and clothe the naked" as Jesus bids us in Matthew  Chapter 25... To use our small" talents" for that work for Jesus and His people. Knowing that when we feed the hungry, we feed Him.... Seeing Him in the many hundreds  of homeless who sleep on the streets in Canada''s harsh and bitter winters.....in the children in Sri Lanka orphaned by the tsunami... <br />
			<br />
			Our Foundress, back in the 1860s in England wrote, as she went about feeding needy ones... " I did meet Jesus again today. He did take the time to speak with me, an unworthy servant."<br />
			In all we serve, He is there, and we take His love with us...Without Him, we are nothing. With Him, we can do all things.<br />
			<br />
			We work for all we give and rely so much on the  generosity of others to enable us to be faithful with this daily need for food and warmth.<br />
			<br />
			Please mail the anchoress for details of how to donate; or buy something from the craft pages.... or, if you cannot give, give Prayer for us and our work.<br />

			Bless you and thank you this day and every day.... in all you are and in all you do and in all you love.. In His Dear and Holy Name Who Alone is All; JESUS"<br /></B>
